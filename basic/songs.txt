Little Things

I said, "put that bubble wrap down man"
Nevermind, I know that you can't, so
Cut me off a piece of that bubble wrap
Snap pop, snap crack

It's the little things that make you smile
It's the little things that drive me wild
Too much of anything can make you sick
Not enough won't do the trick

Thanks, yeah, I have been putting on weight
I've been eating ice cream, staying up late
You know you shouldn't smoke that cigarette
But if you got another one, I'll help you quit

It's the little things that make you smile
It's the little things that drive me wild
Too much of anything can make you sick
Not enough won't do the trick

For goddsakes cover your mouth when you sneeze
It's unsanitary, it causes disease
But I understand man, how good it feels
So let it rip, it's free! what a deal

It's the little things that make you smile
It's the little things that drive me wild
Too much of anything can make you sick
Not enough won't do the trick

I don't say no, I say maybe later
Unless it's your sister in which case the answer is yes, I would date her
Hypothetically speaking, money is no object
But if you go to my website, click the link to my kickstarter project

It's the little things that make you smile
It's the little things that drive me wild
Too much of anything can make you sick
Not enough won't do the trick

I said, "put that bubble wrap down man"
Nevermind, I know that you can't

So few cars in the parking lot you think it's closed
You see yesterday's fashions in the store windows
You step into the building, you made a bad call
When you go shopping at a sad mall

Shops are half empty, make you want to disappear
But the information sign says 'you are here'
Escalator sets you up for a bad fall
When you go walking at a sad mall

	Sad mall, sa-a-ad mall
	if you're ever feeling bad y'all
	Sad mall, sa-a-ad mall
	Don't go shopping at a sad mall

Look on the bright side at the food court
At Auntie Annies and Sbarro the line is short
Leave you feeling cold as a bathroom stall
Eating your dinner at a sad mall

There's nothing funny today at Spencer Gifts
Only one employee sleeping on his shift
He's lonely as a closeout stuffed animal doll
He's working at a sad mall

	Sad mall, sa-a-ad mall
	if you're ever feeling bad y'all
	Sad mall, sa-a-ad mall
	Don't go shopping at a sad mall

There's moss in the fountain, water will not flow
No sunlight needed, plastic plants won't grow
Customers are few and the profits small
If you run a shop at a sad mall

Teenagers on a bench aren't high on pot
Girl with tears on her makeup down at Glamour Shots
The theater still playing Legends of the Fall
That's what they're watching at a sad mall

	Sad mall, sa-a-ad mall
	if you're ever feeling bad y'all
	Sad mall, sa-a-ad mall
	Don't go shopping at a sad mall

The public bathroom gets fucked up every day at four
Messy kids spill their drinks all over the floor
Hand sanitizer won't help at all
You can't feel better at a sad mall

Clearance sale signs are six feet tall
When you go shopping at a sad mall

Black Friday here, you won't see no brawl
Peaceful and quiet at the sad mall, No mace spraying at the sad mall

Something in the air smells like doom y'all
Stale popcorn at a sad mall

A leather case for your Flip Phone at a kiosk stall
When you're shopping at a sad mall

	Sad mall, sa-a-ad mall
	if you're ever feeling bad y'all
	Don't go shopping at a sad mall

It was dazzling, the view from the top of this grand hotel
But now everyone can clearly see that its gone to hell
When you're ready to descend, that's when I'll be around
It's true this elevator is only going down

The button was already depressed when you walked on in
Here's a few words of advice for you before the ride begins
The gears sound like they're crying from carrying this clown
It's true this elevator is only going down

It's true this elevator is only going down
It used to be the envy of   everyone around
A boo-hoo storm is brewing you might need a poncho gown
It's true this elevator is only going down

There's claw marks on the closing doors where I tried hard to break free
The maintenance crew has gone on strike, all the work is left to me  (left all the work to me)
The mirrored walls inside reflect a whiskey frown
It's true this elevator is only going down

It's a slow emergency, no extinguisher will spray
Don't try to make conversation politely stare away
Please don't pull that lever or (And if you pull the lever), a sad alarm will sound
It's true this elevator is only going down

It's true this elevator is only going down
It used to be the envy of   everyone around
This fool thought he spread his wings  but then free fall to the ground
It used to stop on every floor, now it just free falls to the ground
It's true this elevator is only going down


_______

It used to stop at every floor but now its just free falling down
It's true this elevator is only going down

The luggage carts have lost their wheels, wrecked on the loading bay

The Story of the .22 Long

This was my grandpa's favorite shirt
He got it in Fort Worth
he loved the pearl snaps and the piping on it too  A

You see this embroidered rose
Well, in the center there's a bullet hole
that matches the one in the back where it went clean through 

and he's gone now, rest his soul
and I'm the reason this bullet hole
is in this very shirt here that I wear
Oh I loved him but I'm the one who (that) put it there

With that 22 long 
he bought in Arkansas
that hung above the mantle on his living room wall

(musical break)

Well, he'd take it to the shooting match
he won turkeys and he won hams
He kept his family fed when times were lean

When his eyes got bad enough
well he just hung it up
Right there on the wall for all to see

and as they moved from state to state
it always held its special place 
and for over forty years it rested right up there

I told him one day I'd like to have it
he said well son it's yours go grab it
so I went and got a kitchen chair

(to take down that)

22 long 
He bought in Arkansas
that hung above the mantle on his living room wall

(musical break)

I still recall the sound
the crack of that fateful round
as my finger brushed the trigger as he helped me take it down-

(pause)

Well it dang near grazed his ear
Hell it had been loaded for forty three years
and this story might sound a bit hard to believe

but that bullet passed through his closet wall
and all his clothes clean through 'em all
and even this,  favorite shirt of his   that     he left to me

And now that 22 long 
He bought in Arkansas
Hangs above the mantel on MY living room wall

You know it (dang near) could've killed grandpa
but the story still lives on
of the bullet hole that I put in my grandpa's pearl snap shirt with
the 22 long
The Good Stuff

a little less driving, less nine to fivin'
Less traffic riding, a little more train
a little more big sky, lot more sunshine
the view from tall bluff
I want more of the good stuff

Shady creekside, beach walk at high tide
Windows open wide, a nap while it rains
Double header Sunday, not waiting on someday
foul ball in a old glove
I need more of the good stuff

    Taking it easy, little more gravy
    (Little) more hiding out, when life gets crazy
    Hill country red wine , straight off the grapevine
    Time off and true love, now that is the good-- stuff
    a room full of love

old records and cold beer, the ones I hold dear
when they're all right here, its like a old refrain
from your favorite song, can't help but sing along
not perfect but close enough, (you know) more of the good stuff 

  Taking it easy, a little more gravy
  Little more hiding out, when shit gets crazy
  Hill country red wine, straight off the grapevine
  a house full of love, now that is the good-- stuff
  time off and true love, now that is the good-- stuff
  the view from a white chalk bluff, more of the good stuff
   foul ball in a old glove, more of the good stuff
   a room full of love, more of the good-- stuff

Shut Your Mouth


Better mind your manners, better mind my stink eye stare
Or They'll have to hang a sign on your eye that says 'closed for repairs'
Mind your Ps and Qs and all your ABCs
You shut your mouth- when you're talking to me

My fist will give your face a lip so fat
Don't you ever talk to me like that
Or I'll dot your i, and cross your T
You shut your mouth- when you're talking to me


I'm liable to slap you silly or slap you asleep
You shut your mouth- when you're talking to me

You can dance the dance you're dancing all you want
you can think the things your thinking into thoughts
But don't let me hear no words that I can't read
You shut your mouth when your talkin to me
That's Why I'm Leaving Atlanta

That's why I'm leaving Atlanta, that's why I'm driving so fast
I've got a hotwired Camaro, I've got a half tank of gas
My luck ran out in Georgia, I guess that it couldn't last
That's why I'm leaving Atlanta, that's why I'm driving so fast
 
That's why I'm leaving Atlanta, I want Georgia off of my mind
I'd just as soon leave it burning, cause I can't go back in time
I'll get myself back together, leave the past behind
That's why I'm leaving Atlanta, I want Georgia off of my mind
 
One hot night in the city,
blew away all I had planned
She was wearing the ring that I gave her,
But she was holding another man's hand
 
That's why I'm leaving Atlanta, love has come to an end
When the sun comes up tomorrow, they'll know that I'm gone with the wind
It was parked outside their motel room, I stole this car from my wife's new boyfriend
That's why I'm leaving Atlanta, love has come to an end
That's why I'm leaving Atlanta, I want Georgia off of my mind
That's why I'm leaving Atlanta, that's why I'm driving so fast

Angels will descend when least expected

When love's the only thing to be protected

We've all been tempted a time or two
D                               A
By things we did or did not do

                G         A   D
When the lights go down 
              G       A  D
and the show is over
        A     G      D
Only true love remains
       A      G      D

We've all been flattered and told that we
Were the most and best that ever would be
By spirits passing in the night
In the house of mirrors under neon light

When the lights go down 
and the show is over
Only true love remains

I've bought that ticket, I took that ride
But now I come home with nothing to hide
So I'll play these bars and she won't(don't) mind
Cause she knows I'd never cross that line

When the lights go down 
and the show is over
Only true love remains

Where to Go From Here

He said I lost my wife but I love my sons
I'll but down this bottle, put down this gun
its been a long night but in the light of dawn


he made his choice to rise not fall
he smashed the bottle against we wall
walked out the door, its time to soldier on




He's a soldier tried and true he fought like hell for the red white and blue

When the Whiskey Wears Off

When the whiskey wears off, I'll start drinking again about you
When the whiskey wears off, I'll start drinking again about you

You left a broken heart when you left me behind
I got a broken record going round in my mind
You can't drown out memories with whiskey but it's worth a try
You left a long time ago but I can't tell your memory goodbye

When the whiskey wears off, I'll start drinking again about you
Wishing and missing til lovers and lies come true
Wearing a memory down with a bottle I can hold on to
When the whiskey wears off, I'll start drinking again about you

Losing you was easy but you're hard to forget
So I empty all these bottles full of regret
What's keeping me alive is gonna kill me one day I know
But I can't stop now tell me baby why you had to go

When the whiskey wears off, I'll start drinking again about you
Wishing and missing til lovers and lies come true
Wearing a memory down with a bottle I can hold on to
When the whiskey wears off, I'll start drinking again about you


Bridge  



I think about you, I think about us, 
I think I'll have another round

Burning Sun

Like walking off a sunlit porch into a darkened room
you back into the shadows, disappearing soon
whispering softly our time is almost done
you are the moonlight, I am the burning sun

Reflecting soft and silver, moves full of grace
somehow we can't get closer, I see it on your face
you'll come around to say we've only just begun
you are the moonlight, I am the burning sun

     Burning sun, burning sun
     you are the moonlight, I am the burning sun

Phases and stages we keep going through
you rely on me, and I rely on you
shining down, sunset to dawn
you are the moonlight, I am the burning sun

     Burning sun, burning sun
     you are the moonlight, I am the burning sun
     burning sun, burning sun
     you are the moonlight, I am the burning sun

In Times, In Rhymes

Give me a path to walk upon cause I think I lost my way
Tell me a lie or tell me the truth, turn this night into day
I saw the letter that you wrote, I saw the pictures on the wall
This place seemed so big back then but now it seems so small
in times, and/in rhymes away from you

I love you with all my heart but I've never seen your face
I've been searching everywhere, you're gone without a trace
Yeah I've been to Texas, I've been to Europe too
Now I'm staying where I am, waiting for you
in times, and/in rhymes away from you

I try to make it on my own, how far can I go
I know friend you been there too, its either high or low
Baby I've been to River Field, I've been to Mountain Home
8 strangers took me there, and left me all alone
in times, and/in rhymes away from you

instrumental

Give me a path to walk upon cause I think I lost my way
Tell me a lie or tell me the truth, turn this night into day
I've been everywhere but I couldn't see
I looked in the mirror, and I saw that you were me
in times, and/in rhymes away from you





Jude Look On Down

1
This farm is all that we've got left
If it rains we can pay down the debt
We grow corn but they grow banks
Now they're raising up interest rates

I took a loan out to buy seed
But all we got was dust and weeds       

Hey Jude is it a hopeless case
Read the lines written on my face
We're overdue for a turnaround
Saint Jude look on down
Hey Jude look on down

2
I lit a candle the day she left
Said a prayer all by myself
Let it blow over like the times before
One more chance is all I'm asking for

Drank to the bottom of a half full cup
Hey Jude can you help me up?

Hey Jude is it a hopeless case
Read the lines written on my face
I'm overdue for a turnaround
Saint Jude look on down
Hey Jude look on down

3
Red and blue, left and right 
Rich and poor, day and night
north and south, east and west
Talking about who can run it best

Run up the tab like we got it made
Look on the bright side, but wear your shades

Hey Jude is it a hopeless case
Read the lines written on my face
We're overdue for a turnaround
Saint Jude look on down
Hey Jude look on down

Drank to the bottom of a half full cup
Hey Jude can you help me up?
Hey Jude look on down
Hard to say how we got off track
We'd do it over if we had it back


It All Comes Back Around

E

She was pouring drinks all night under the neon light
She worked hard all her life, she had a heart of gold
She always had something kind to say for the old man every day
the day he died he left all he had to her 

ALL the things you do
walking the higher ground
the truth comes shining through
Yeah, it all comes back around

He always took the time to help the folks he'd find
(they were) Standing in the welfare line (he'd) to help em get a job
He built his business up they say hiring people he found that way
Now he's a rich man today but you would never KNOW

ALL the things you do
walking the higher ground
the truth comes shining through
Yeah, it all comes back around

Every time he says goodbye, she tries not to cry
she knows the reasons why, she understands 
he puts his life on the line patrolling highway 59
he says I'll be just fine and then he's gone

ALL the things you do
walking the higher ground
the truth comes shining through
Yeah, it all comes back around
That Was Me

No account peckerwood, hat in his hand
With a guitar full of songs that nobody understands
Skinny white kid with a big fat dream
Huffing and a puffing and a busting at the seams

That was me, that was me
Look what I growed up to be
A sight for sore eyes to see
That was me

Gangbanger vato he was wet behind the ears
Swung a sock full of quarters got a jailhouse tear
Drinking Bud and Clamato just to have a good time
Staring at a tortilla just a looking for a sign

CHORUS

Drank a twack of Coors now he's drunk on a mule
Eat a chuckwagon dinner and he'll call you a fool
Failed attempts at conversation 'nless about John Prine
Texas burning down weighing heavy on his mind

CHORUS

Red Rocks

I know the sun comes up each and every day
But there's nothing like the light out old New Mexico way
God creates long shadows and turquoise sky above
Nothing left to think about but what I'm thinking of

Red rocks bouncing sunlight across a sacred ground
The old earth sighs preparing for another time around
And the wind comes calling like a whisper in my ear
When the sunset's falling with any luck I'll still be here

I used to live for glory, time belonged to me
Now I am just grateful for where I get to be
I stand here thankful, for the peace I've found
Another day of living on four billion years of ground

Red rocks bouncing sunlight across a sacred ground
The old earth sighs preparing for another time around
And the wind comes calling like a whisper in my ear
When the sunset's falling with any luck I'll still be here

I Hope Heaven Knows My Name

Sunday mornings Granddad would give me
a quarter if he said he could hear me
singing at the top of my lungs
every hymn until the singing was done
singing for my pay

He taught me about the golden rule
do unto others as you'd have em do to you
remember on the day that he died
how me and my sister cried
aint it a shame

but grandma smiled 
said dont worry child / said dont you worry child / she said dont worry child 
cause heaven knows his name

     so when my time has come
     and my race is run
     I hope its not, not all in vain
     they'll say pass on through
     we've been expecting you
     Lord I pray- heaven knows my name

Now when it comes to living my life
I know that wrong is wrong and right is still right
i'm not in the church's front row
but i think Jesus and my granddad know
I will find my way

     so when my time has come 
     and my race is run
     I hope its not, not all in vain
     they'll say pass on through
     we've been expecting you
     Lord I pray- heaven knows my name
The Wildest Colts Make The Best Horses

They say the wildest colts make the best horses
I've traveled many trails and many courses
I've shattered bones and broken dreams
Trying to find out what life means
The wildest colts make the best horses
The wildest colts make the best horses


I been taking life     by the horns --
I been a free spirit since the day was born
With a gypsy soul and a wanderlust
Roll the dice, jackpot or bust --
I been taking life by the horns
I been taking life by the horns

G E
B


When you're hung up, I'll pull the tail--
I'll wade high water, I'll walk through hell
When the pale horse is breathing down your neck
I'll step in pull you from the wreck
When you're hung up, I'll pull the tail
When you're hung up, I'll pull the tail

G E
B

They say the wildest colts make the best horses
I've traveled many trails and many courses
With my shattered bones and broken dreams
I finally found out what life means
The wildest colts make the best horses
They say the wildest colts make the best horses

He Looks a Lot Like You

I came back from the garden, flower in my hair
I wasn't disenchanted, but I was getting there
Looking back to when we were young
Pretty words from a silver tongue
"Got a job in Tennessee, baby won't you come with me"

     Cupid hovers overhead
     Bow and arrow drawn
     Sometimes he hits the target
     Sometimes-- he just moves on

The first time that I met him, I was seventeen
He was without question, the finest thing I'd seen
I didn't know what to tell him
I didn't know how to say
"I am just a baby, too young to run away"

     Cupid hovers overhead
     Bow and arrow drawn
     Sometimes he hits the target
     Sometimes-- he just moves on

If he'd just come back again, I swear I'd stand real still
Offer up my heart and soul, let him go in for the kill
(solo)

Standing where he left me as the evening shadows fall
Sometimes there's a moment when you know you've lost it all
But there's no time for memories
Supper's overdue
There's a baby tugging at my dress and he looks a lot like you

     Cupid hovers overhead
     Bow and arrow drawn
     Sometimes he hits the target
     Sometimes-- he just moves on

If I Had a Time Machine

TVs telling what to worry about
Warning labels raising doubts
Low carb low fat have no fun      (higher)
Into the   shade, stay out of the sun

If I had a time machine     I know where I would go
I'd go to when I didn't know

If I would smoke a fine cigar
You bet I'm told what the dangers are
If I'm hungry out one day
Super size - still not ok

If I had a time machine      I know where I would go
I'd go to when I didn't know

(break)

I know I have to pay the bill
But you don't have to kill the thrill
Facts are facts but life is good
When I don't know what you think I should

If I had a time machine         I know where I would go
I'd go to when I didn't know

In the good old days ignorance was bliss
and not knowing - that's what I miss

If I had a time machine I know where I would go
I'd go to when I didn't know

A Waste of Time to Me

billboard ads, internet scams
ringtones, traffic jams
bad beer and fast food
worry all day in a bad mood
gameshows on TV    QVC on TV
it's all just a waste of time to me

drawn out stories that go nowhere
i'd rather be asleep in my easy chair
you may be the star of your own show
but i got things to do, places to go
talk is cheap and nothing's free
and its all just a waste of time to me

Its all just a waste of time
I need more space in my peace of mind
They all keep talking they dont make sense
I cant pay attention it's all been spent   its already spent

cybersex and robocalls 
long lines in shopping malls
junk mail, undue stress
neckties and sweater vests
tollbooth drive thru pay a fee
its all just a waste of time to me

paperwork and run around
red tape and a dry town
bad books and panty hose (reality shows)
control freaks and big egos
im tired of it baby set me free
it's all just a waste of time to me


Its all just a waste of time
I need more space in my peace of mind
They all keep talking they dont make sense
I cant pay attention it's all been spent
its all just a waste of time to me
its all just a waste of time to me


Satisfied

You've got a pen that writes smooth
You're wearing comfortable shoes
Somehow you shook yesterday's blues
You feel satisfied

A week of work that's not too hard
next place to be is not too far
Still got some years left in this car
Makes you feel satisfied

It's not too hot it's not too cold
you got a hand to hold
an easy feeling in your soul
you feel satisfied

[solo]

The kind of smile you cannot fake
Good food you didn't have to make
A girl's dreams will twist and shake
But you seem satisfied

You've done the best that you can
not quite the way you planned
they stood in line to shake your hand
you're gonna feel satisfied

You've got someone to call
You've got a place to fall
sink to sleep against midnights wall
You feel satisfied

[solo]

Not too much going wrong
You're older now but feeling strong
you're singing your favorite song
you feel satisfied
feeling satisfied

Country Girls

She can catch a fish, fry it up in a pan
Drink cold beer out of a can
Barefoot wearing cut off shorts
She likes cookin' and cleaning and watching sports.
(She rides a horse and wears a hat
Yeah county girls is where it's at)

She ain't high maintenance she likes boxed wine
Can turn that John deer on a dime
Playin' in the garden, she likes the dirt
Wearing cowboy boots and a mini skirt
(She grows them maters juicy and  fat
Yeah country girls is where it's at)

Knows how to two step all night long
She can sing the words to all my songs
Dancing on tables in honky tonk bars
Demolition derby, fixin' old cars
( she holds her on she's a lady like that
Yeah country girs is where it's at)

Driving a truck, hauling some hay
She works real hard and at the end of the day
Comes home frisky for her man
And I'm trying to keep up as best I can
(Always on the go she's a real wildcat
Yeah country girls is where its at)


Down on South Lamar


If find yourself down on South Lamar
You're gonna need to find a spot to park your car
Step right up you can order at the bar
If you find yourself down on South Lamar

you got The Saxon pub and the horseshoe lounge,
at the Broken spoke you can get your two step down   /  has a spot settle down
hear the fiddle play and a crying steel guitar
If you find yourself down on South Lamar

always something going on night or day
keep Austin weird so that's what they say
but i tell you friend it can get downright bizarre
If you find yourself down on South Lamar

I'm gonna find me a spot under a shady tree
south of town that where I want to be 


there's a swinging band and the cover charge is free
you never know - who or what you'll see
you might be sitting next to a movie star
when you find yourself down on South Lamar

they got the coldest beer and real good barbecue
spent all day here, and still there's more to do
Need a Tex Mex fix, don't have to stumble far
If you find yourself down on South Lamar

Gunpowder and Rum


the old man roars awake, eyes wide open as the sun
a faint odor in the air of gunpowder and rum
he bangs out a thousand words, blows em to to kingdom come
winds up every day with gunpowder and rum 

Key West and Cuba from Oak Park, Illinois
they always called him papa, even when he was a boy
first time he held a pistol, he never saw it as a toy
Key West and Cuba from Oak Park, Illinois

when World War One exploded, the wound never healed
lean and tight his words laid down like mortar over steel
he'd just report the facts but fiction felt more real
when World War One exploded, the wound never healed

the bell tolls for thee, reads the letter from John Donne
the six toed cat does more work and he has more fun
the mice don't stand a chance, they don't even run
the bell tolls for thee, reads the letter from John Donne

one day he found himself asleep, the words just wouldn't come
it was overcast in Idaho, no glimmer from the sun
work to live or live to work, nowhere left to run
snow fell on the ground, blank and heavy as the gun   
  
through Michigan and Italy, South Africa to Spain
words crossed over continents stubborn as a train
not gunpowder nor rum,  only words could kill the pain
through Michigan and Italy, South Africa to Spain

a faint odor in the air of gunpowder and rum
the old man roars awake, eyes wide open as the sun

Things I Didn't Do

you think she's looking for a fight
one that may last through the night
don't turn around and go back to town
until the morning light

you don't want to take her call
you don't want to talk at all
pick up the phone, and head back home 
before you lose it all
i've got all this good advice for you
it's all the things i didn't do

admitting that you're wrong
it doesn't take as long
as digging in, trying to win
and dragging on and on

when she's hard to understand
it's time to be a man
it ain't a game, take the blame
take hold of her hand
yeah i've got all this good advice for you
it's just the things i didn't do

(bridge)
if i were sitting there today
listening to what i say
i'd shake my head and do it my own way
it's a straight and narrow line
and that path is hard to find
on my own, i missed it every time
i've got all this good advice for you
cause they're the things i didn't do

now i'm sitting here alone
a place that doesn't feel like home
i wish i would have listened to me then
i'd have more than good advice for you
and all these things i didn't do
oh i'd have more than good advice for you
and things i didn't do
In Washington


In Washington the election's done but the fight's not won 
they speak of Rome in hushed tones at the capitol dome
talk of golden fleece and the war for peace
the squeaky wheels get more grease
In Washington the election's done but the fight's not won 

The wolf at the door always wanted more than the sick and poor
He's underfed and he heard it said sheep wanted him dead 
now the woods are on fire, the situations dire, 
he heard that his tax cuts would/did expire   just expired
The wolf at the door always wanted more than the sick and poor

the lobbyists race with their briefcase on the paper chase
the speaker of the house quiet as a mouse he has his doubts
the minority whip, let it slip 
and the senators statement broke his hip
the lobbyists race with their briefcase on the paper chase

the sex lives of the other guys is where the power lies
the closet's closed, and the skeletons were all exposed
the banker was too big to fail
but the general just got out of jail
the sex lives of the other guys is where the power lies

Deep Throat in an overcoat wrote a me a note
he asked me which side of history do you want to be
his note said the truth will out
speak of what you care about
on which side of history do you want to be

In Washington the election's done but the fight's not won 
Black or White

I got a little girl downtown, but another one sitting at home
one of em says I should come around, the other says leave me alone
one of them says she loves me, the other one gives me good love
one of em says I come around too much, the other says never enough

it's day or night     /  black or white
wrong or right
blind or sight
there ain't no gray in my life
this yin yang thing
it's black or white

there's a little church I go to and a bar on 33
one of them's my salvation the other one sets me free
one of them closes at noon, the other one's open all night
they never meet up in the afternoon so there's never really a fight

it's day or night
wrong or right
blind or sight
there ain't no gray in my life
this yin yang thing
it's (is) black or white

faith and love and politics dividing up the crowd
can't find hope and balance with everybody talking so loud

it's day or night
wrong or right
blind or sight
there ain't no gray in my life
this yin yang thing
it's black or white


(Casey Berry / Brian Keane / Owen Temple)


Twelve O'Clock High

I got a 12 oclock high and it's only ten
Why o why did I do it again
I know I gotta reel it in
Got a 12 o clock high and it's only ten

You been drinkin from the glass
I been drinkin from the bottle
You been drinking a little
I been drinkin a lottle
When the money's all gone
The good times will follow
and it don't take long
your down to your last swallow

I got a 12 oclock high and it's only ten
Why o why did I do it again
I know I gotta reel it in
Got a 12 o clock high and it's only ten

I'm two hours ahead
I made a mistake
I ate too much candy
I ate too much cake
I drank too much whiskey
I drank too much gin
Now I've seen the future
I'll be drunk there again

I'm A Winner

I opened up the mail, I thought it was a bill but it was anthrax again
Car wont start, toilets clogged, i got punched in the chin
A kid said you're a dumb old fool, and its true I aint no beginner
When it comes to being a loser I'm a winner.

My neighbor's Great Dane took a shit in the yard and ran off down the street
My shoes got so many damn holes I'm just lacing up my feet
I went to church and the preacherman said "get out of here, you old sinner"
When it comes to being a loser I'm a winner.

I've long since stopped seeing royalty checks for 'Dirty South' 
the left over truck stop burrito just burned the roof of my mouth
It was 2 days old like the heartbreak she left but it was all I had for dinner
When it comes to being a loser I'm a winner.

I went to California on the Price is Right, in the audience dressed like a clown
I bid correct on the Rice a Roni, Bob Barker said to come on down
I did my best but I fell on my ass pullin on that giant spinner
When it comes to being a loser I'm a winner
Bob said, you're bankrupt, loser, and I'm a winner
I Need a Vacation From This Vacation

Your inlaws are hard on a body's heart
And I get the sense that this is just the start
Another week to go, time creeps by so slow
This holiday will tear us apart


Waves of stress hormones crash on the beach of my brain
As I hear your mother's old refrain
Your father never bores of telling me 'bout the war
And it's driving me insane


I need a vacation from this vacation
I need some time off from this holiday
I need a vacation from this vacation
I want to go home to our home for the holidays

I can't eat one more piece of fruitcake
Jell-O surpise I just cannot take
Why can't we go home, spend the holidays alone
We made a terrible mistake
The Devil Got Kicked Out of Rock N Roll

The Devil cant ride with the band anymore, they wont take his calls
They used him up and left him standing at reststop in Wichita Falls
He used to get their sympathy, they used to like running with him
But last time he knocked on the door of the bus, they said, "D we cant let you in"
"D we cant let you in"

Keith and Mick and the rest of the boys, made him feel like part of the band
Now he's getting the old cold shoulder in a way he doesnt understand
Devil wore out his welcome, til the all the new wore off of sin
He thought he was the star of the show, thought they were the best of friends
thought he was their new best friend

Now the Devil got kicked out of rock n roll
With nobody selling any records, he cant get em to sell their soul
He's not invited to the parties anymore, the groupies don't say his name
Now that the Devil's kicked out of rock n roll, he cant help but feel ashamed

He didnt pass the joint when it come around, his stories got a little too long
The devil became a pain in the ass after they mentioned him in a song
He was eating up the band's deli tray, the day his song fell off the charts
when a roadie pulled him aside and said "D, we need some time apart,"
"we need some time apart"



Oh No

You deserve a man who'll buy you pretty things
Put you on a pedestal with diamond rings
I wont shake my fist and call you dirty names
Wont say its all your fault when i'm the one to blame
Oh no, oh no

I'll buy you lots of food and not just chicken wings
I'll pick up a guitar and try to play you things
Wont complain about your family when they come to town
Wont hit on your best friends when they come around
Oh no, oh no, oh no

I will not have affairs with old whatshernames
Wont embarrass you in public after bowling games
Won't snort amphetamine off of your starbucks card
And throw your scrap book memories out into the yard
Oh no, oh no, oh no

You deserve a man who'll buy you pretty things
Fancy lace and pretty party dingalings
I wont call up, exgirlfriends when you're not around
You deserve a man who'll never let you down
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Not me

Let It Thunder, Let It Rain


The heavens open - it is falling down
On the rooftop- I hear the sound
Open the window- feel it in the air
And I dont need to go
I dont need to go

G Let it thunder let it rain
Hear it drumming on my windowpane
Keeps me a little more sane
Let it thunder- let it rain

Break the heat- I feel electrified
Cause I've been drowning in the blue blue sky
A new beginning- feel it in the air
I feel it everywhere
feel it everywhere

G Let it thunder let it rain
I hear it drumming on my windowpane
It keeps me a little more sane
Let it thunder- let it rain

Tomorrow the sun will shine but today I just need the rain
I need the rain-

this is not just another angel song
nor just another tale bout an ol leprechaun / not a worn out tale about an ol leprechaun
its about an angel crossing i one day chanced upon
this is not just another angel song

A wretch like me Used to drive around
I'd be haulin ass All around this town
Til I spied a crossing guard with gilded wings
That old boy sure could sing

lots of songs got angels all around
you never know where a angel might be found
in a verse or chorus, x marks the wing
of an angel crossing is what I sing
 
people we've got to love each other
these angels cant do it all on their own
Look children 
Poorly marked
Angel crossing

I'm About to Give You the Blues

My mama said son - you can barely clap hands
You got no business - playing in a band
She said you got no rhythm - you got no clue
But I don't care what mama says about what I can't do
I don't care what she says - even if it's true
She says I should just go back home
But I'm about to give you the blues

I found a empty stage, i stole a guitar
they said you got no soul, you wont get far
they said, no really, dont even try
but soon i saw their sad faces, teardrops in their eye
If you were born to win, get ready to lose
Damn right I'm about to-
i'm about to give you the blues

I tried so hard - to get the blues
Just couldn't make it happen - couldn't find that muse
I was born in the suburbs - just outside of town
But now I'm on a roll - just rocking into your town
Guess i must have somehow missed all the clues
Don't matter if you want em - i'm about to give you the blues

Before I get started, I got to give you the news
People get ready, i'm about to give you the blues

I just gave y'all the blues
I think I just gave yall the blues

Things Change


I had no doubt what we had would last forever
Til the blue skies turned to grey and the sun went down
My hearts been torn up by stormy weather
But with a new day, things can turn around


		The winds of change are blowing strong
		The one thing you can count on - is change
		Just when you thought you had mate and check
		The dealer comes along and shuffles the deck
		Things change
		Things change

I've been around the world, finally found a place to stay
You do your best to plan ahead but you never know
There's been floods and dry spells all along the way
But I've been planting seeds for awhile now and watching em grow

		The winds of change are blowing strong
		The one thing you can count on - is change
		Just when you thought you had mate and check
		The dealer comes along and shuffles the deck
		Things change
		Things change
Fall For You

I can't dance but if I could I would dance with you
I can't lie but if I could I would lie to you
Truth wont set us free, so I'll tell you true
I can't fall but if I could I would fall for you

Going round in circles blurring all the lines
You have made your promises and I have made mine
What might be is just a dream, with words we never said
memory and history are like daylight in my head

all the steps we take, see them to the end
Wasted time and tangled lines is all we might begin
I can love you best without loving you at all
when your phone doesn't ring, its me who didn't call 

I can't dance but if I could I would dance with you
I can't lie but if I could I would lie to you
Truth wont set us free, so I'll tell you true
I can't fall but if I could I would fall for you





The Ballad of Coyote

Down from the Big Shining Mountain
The Great River rolls
Summers were fair but when winters there
Man shivered in the cold

The animals knew when the cold winds blew
many people of the village would die
But Coyote knew of the fire spirits who
guarded the world's only fire

Coyote went to the top of mountain 
and hid out of sight
he saw the flames dance and he took a dry branch
stole a piece of the flickering light

the fire keepers chased as Coyote raced
down the mountain fast as he could
the fire he stole became an ember of coal
he tossed it into the wood

yodle lo yodle lo yodle lo
chase away the night
yodle lo yodle lo yodle lo
bringing the warmth and the light

the wood burned, the fire keepers returned 
and the people protected the spark
fire kept in the wood and they learned they could
chase away the cold and the dark

What Coyote began can still scorch the land
and burns for miles and miles
turns the land black but there's no giving back
Coyote's gift of the fire

yodle lo yodle lo yodle lo
chase away the night
yodle lo yodle lo yodle lo
bringing the warmth and the light


Heart Light 

I've got a slow burning fuse, nothing to lose
Eyes wide open and I'm enjoying the view
Don't spend your life paying rent
Life never ends if its passionately spent

So maybe we can get close enough
For me to find that special touch
That makes your heart light up
makes your heart light up

Diamonds from your lips, words too precious to waste
if you've got a bleeding heart, I'm your quiet place 

Before you get going won't you take a look again
Throw your arms round your one true friend

So maybe we can get close enough
For me to find that special touch
That makes your heart light up
makes your heart light up

Let's race the sun, rise and shine
Don't hide your face from me, the morning light is kind

Before you get going won't you take a look again
Throw your arms round your one true friend

I can fell us getting close enough
Right on the verge of finding that special touch
That makes your heart light up
 makes your heart light up
Pulling Together

I want to thank you for being my friend
I want to tell you how good it feels holding your hand
What we have done and what we must do
Whatever comes I'm sticking with you
Links in a chain, we will remain
Pulling together

Sometimes we feel weak, sometimes we feel strong
The work we're here to do takes so long
Looking back see how far we've come
You and me we get the job done
Links in a chain, we will remain
Pulling together

Pulling together through thick and thin
When the going gets tough, take my hand
Pulling together we will remain
You and me, we're links in a chain
Links in a chain, we will remain
Pulling together

You know I got your back and you got mine
Chains of love stretching out through space and time
Ties that bind so sweet as we go along
We got a firm foundation we're building on 
Links in a chain, we will remain
Pulling together


 


Holding on tight to the ties that bind
feels so right cant unwind
Links in a chain, we will remain
Pulling together

It's Like Love

It's like a diamond made from a piece of coal
It's like a song that comes from the soul
Its magic I can't explain, its a fastmoving runaway train
It's like love


It's like a star shooting cross the sky
It's like a child always asking why
its something its in the air, its dancing like you just dont care
It's like love


(wait) It's like that first kiss that you could build a dream on
And that dream goes on and on and on


Its like reaching? the summit of a mountain top
Like the feeling when you get to the mountain top

Like a ride you never want to stop
its going out with bang
what you give is what you gain
Its like a 66 ford mustang
It's like love

like a sunset when you're barefoot stuck in the sand
like the touch of her taking my hand
its a show you dont want to end, falling for her all over again
its like love


Its like waking up to a double rainbow 
making out under the bleachers of the rodeo
like laughing in the rain
Like the yin to the yang
its like love
Got to Get There Somehow

Now I'm not what you might call a drinker
I might have a glass of wine with my wife
Now I'm not what you might call a smoker
Though I've been known to take a toke once or twice
I'm not what you'd call a dreamer
But since my kids took my license away
I never been a schemer 
but I'm driving a lawnmower today

I got to get there somehow, I got to get there someway
So I'm on a rider mower, I stole a lawnmower today

I'm on a fixed income, so I can't get too far
I had to get downtown, I had to go play cards
And I'm not what you'd call addicted, but I crossed the line a time or two
If you only knew what I did, you'd drive a lawnmower too
So don't call me crazy and I won't call you a bitch
Then I won't have to light my mower on fire, and crash it into a ditch

I got to get there somehow, I got to get there someway
So I'm on a rider mower, I stole a lawnmower today



The King and Queen of Blanco's

Blanco's is the honkiest tonkiest joint in Houston 
The Western swingingest couple that ever walked through that door 
They're the first ones at their table in the early evening 
They win over everybody when they're dancing out on the floor 

Joe Parsons is the man with the smile and the handlebar moustache 
Ann Parsons is the cute white haired lady at his side 
They've danced across more than their share of dancehalls 
Since '46 when Ann said she'd be Joe's bride 

Chorus 
They're the kind of good folks we all want to be 
They're not wearing crowns but they're Texas royalty 
The noblest couple we've seen and everybody knows 
They'll always be the king and queen of Blanco's 

In River Oaks rednecks are few and far between 
But Joe Parson's one and his little lady is his queen 
Good friends and fans of the music that the couple hears 
Good friends to each other, been married fifty five years 

Chorus 

Now Ann has found a bigger and a broader dancehall 
The Blanco's above (where there's no) doesn't have a closing time 
She's got their table reserved so she told Joe not to hurry 
She knows when Joe gets to heaven he'll be heading for the Blanco's sign 

Chorus

Downhill in All Directions

My boot heel caught the doorway 
As I staggered off the plane 
I'm broken every time I'm here 
Half drunk or half insane 

I feel a need get Floyd County 
Dirt beneath my shoes 
In the cool shade of the pines 
With folks I cannot bear to lose 

Prechorus 
They call it high and lonesome 
But it don't feel that way 
I stop and chat a while 
Though it's not my time to stay 

Chorus 
Downhill in all directions 
for me to get back home 
A place I don't forget 
But not the only one I've known 

Though my kin are dead and gone 
I never felt alone 
Downhill in all directions 
For me to get back- home 

My family's come together now 
In the leaves and autumn air 
I'm comforted just knowing 
That they're always there 

All the folks that loved me 
When I's lost are who I've found 
I come down here to see them 
When I'm back in my hometown 

Prechorus 

Chorus 

The stones tell all their names 
One day they'll tell mine 
Though I leave this valley now 
I'll come back one last time

Cash Is Always Greener On The Other Side

There's just two conditions with money 
None and not enough 
I can't say I don't need it 
Cause life without it's rough 

But I've noticed the limits 
Of what it can provide 
If can make you comfortable 
It can't make you satisfied 

Chorus 

Cause all I want is all that I can get 
And I am not a man who's got enough yet 
I've got all I ever needed but I'm still not satisfied 
Because the cash is always greener on the other side 

I hunt for more everyday 
At night its in my dreams 
Each time I get the amount I want 
It's not as much as it seems 
And I'm happy when I spend it 
But a little less every time 
And the key to lasting happiness 
Is getting more expensive to find 

Some say wealth is relative 
And its all in our minds 
But I've got no rich relatives 
To leave it all behind 

But if one leaves me a pile of money 
I might find peace at last 
But then I've inherited a gift 
For spending money fast

Salvador

The wing tipped towards the mountains 
As we flew in past the shore 
They say there's peace down in the jungle now 
But I hear echoes of a war 
Near buildings draped with razor wire 
And doors locked tight with bars 
A giant statue of Jesus 
Stands above a flood of cars 

Well they gave this land the Savior's name 
Though I'm wondering now what for 
Still looking for salvation 
Down In El Salvador 
I'd Do Anything For Your Love

The first moment I saw you, came up with a plan 
To win you at all costs, do all I can 
To get your attention couldn't stoop too low 
My words don't count for much but I put on a good show 

I dress how you want grow out or cut my hair 
I'll even try to dance if it will make you stare 
I've seen you notice guys that talk real loud 
They smile and wave their arms to get noticed by the crowd 

Chorus 
You've got a short attention span 
But I've just got to be your man 
To be the one you're thinking of 
I'd do anything for your love 

Don't listen to my words if you're not that type 
What I can't get with heart I'm gonna get with hype 
A monkey with the cymbals in my hand 
Lowest common denominator I'm your man 

I didn't come hear to try to make you think 
I've got to get you to the bar to order one more drink 
I'll do Sweet Home Alabama if that's what you need 
Throw in a few remarks ëbout drinking beer and smokin' weed 

Chorus 

I sell all kinds of T-shirts short sleeve and long 
I've got twenty more shirts than original songs 
But you've got to keep printin' em the great ones say 
With the right T shirt design you could go all the way 

I'm gonna drop a couple names now what do you say 
Here's to Townes Van Zandt and the U.S.A. 
Women, Beer, Texas, whiskey on my mind 
Who says the perfect lyrics are so hard to find 

Chorus

Dysfunctional Love


We met through the personal ads online   
I clicked on your profile and you clicked on mine 
An email courtship too good to be true 
So we found a judge and we said I do 

Since you made this trailer house into your home 
Calls from the police ring my telephone 
You maxed out with home shopping stolen credit cards 
You threw all my things out into the yard 

Chorus
I [could] might find other lovers less crazy than you 
The straight jacket love is hard to break through 
It holds us tight when push comes to shove 
But you put the fun in dysfunctional love 
You put the fun in dysfunctional love 

Days full of surprises with you as my lover 
Like the time out at Wal-Mart you pulled a gun on my mother 
We laughed about that, when it was all said and done 
They got it on camera you waving that gun 

Bridge 
When you get that crazy love look in your eye 
My heart skips a beat - I'm afraid I might die 

Last I heard you were living near the border 
Didn't mean what I said in that restraining order 
Love is a fire you can't put out, they say 
Like the fire in our trailer when you moved away

Number One Cause of Divorce

Birthday: 11/20/06  


Celebrity divorce, gay wedding ban 
Seems this getting married thing is getting out of hand  
Read it in the paper the statistic shows  
Love decays just as much as it grows  

Chorus   
Everywhere you go you hear the play by play  
Fifty fifty odds of ending up that way  
They go together like a carriage and a horse  
Marriage is the number one cause of divorce  

I heard a jewelry store ad on the radio say  
Love only grows and grows but I don't see it that way  
Hell they sell more diamonds [sing high] when divorces go through  
Marry once, buy one, remarry, buy two  

Chorus   

Merle Haggard five times, Willie Nelson, four 
Liz Taylor married men she'd divorced before 
The Great Tammy Wynette just couldn't stand four men      
If at first you don't succeed you got to try again 

To six different wives Henry the Eighth gave a wedding ring 
That's one less time than the seven wives of Larry King 

Will it all work out when it's said and done 
Is it marital bliss or just another dry run          
The great threat to marriage, it seems so strange 
Is it who can get married or that people change 
Brittney and Kevin Federline 
Rush Limbaugh said  "I do," "No, I don't" three different times  

I Don't Even Know Her Name  

Blond hair, brown eyes 
And she just stole my heart 
Took it away from me 
Tore it all apart 
I didn't catch her name 
And I don't know where she's from 
She walked in looking so good 
While I stood here looking dumb 

Oh no I'm in love with you baby 
And I don't even know your name 
You walked in shining like a diamond 
and now I'm never gonna be the same 
I forgot every other girl 
In every other place I've been 
But I just gave my heart to a girl 
I'm never gonna see again 

She danced, she smiled 
And she took my breath away 
When her eyes met mine 
I couldn't find a single word to say 
So I stepped out back 
For a breath of fresh air 
But when I came back in she was gone 
My heart left with her there 

When I asked around 
Nobody had seen her there before 
So I'm watching and waiting every night 
For love to come through that swinging door 
 for my love to come through that door 



Motel Blues

G 

I got the motel blues, 
I feel battered and used 
Like this furniture, cheap and rundown 
Though I'll leave it soon 
Tonight I'm stuck in this room, 
With the blues that keep hanging around 
In places down the line, 
I know I'm bound to find 
More of what I've been trying to lose 
Hurry up and wait 
Cause I've got a date 
Tonight with the motel blues 
An offer I can't refuse, paying my dues, 
Singing the motel blues 

When I made my reservation, 
I had reservations 
And doubts about what I would see 
Cause you don't know 
Its clean room HBO 
Til you open the door with your key 
But I turned on all the lights 
Watched TV all night 
Car chases roared off the screen 
They don't scare the blues away 
They check in to stay 
When you're out here stuck in between          
The flicker of cable news, I never take off my shoes 
Singing the motel blues 

We'll be in the same room, 
Together 'gain soon 
Cause I don't feel at home on the range 
I'm walking the floor 
Like so many times before 
Watching the clock numbers change 
When the morning sunlight 
Gets past curtains drawn tight 
This place won't look all that bad 
I'll get on with the day 
Just driving away 
Forgetting the blues that I had 
Part of the life that I choose, chasing the muse 
Singing the motel blues 


Rad Memories of Mine (Summer 1989)

She's was hotter than the summer sidewalk
Barefoot walking to the public pool
We watched MTV and I held her hand
Video countdown after school

We were moving on up with George and Weezy
Making out with the A-Team on
Is that Freedom Rock man well turn it up
Two crazy kids at the high school prom

Rad memories of mine
Summer 1989

She worked at the Northcross mall
In my peg rolled Jordache I was standing there
French kissing at the Orange Julious
Coca cola shirts n' Flock of Seagulls hair

Rad memories of mine
Summer 1989


Shout on the Telephone

A 

Chorus 
I can't shout right now on the telephone 
Cause when we hang up we'll just feel more alone 
Let's talk this thing over babe when we get home 
We don't want to shout on a telephone 

I hear you loud and clear babe, I'd feel that way too 
I know where you're coming from, but then what can we do 
Let's put our heads together, we can work this out 
When we get home we won't have to shout 

Chorus 

Roger that honey, got a copy 10-4 
But I can't talk now on the phone anymore 
We know better than to start this thing up 
If we won't get no resolution by the tie we hang up 

Chorus 

Bridge 
Soon I'll hold you in my arms I can whisper in your ear 
Now we've got a bad connection though the signal's clear 

Chorus

Uphill Climb

Yesterdays whispering
in my ear
news of another time
thought i heard --
your voice so clear
echoes in my mind

where have we been
together my friend
it's an uphill climb
together my friend

we cried and we smoked
until the sun came up
at the end of the year
the morning comes
the roll was called
but we did not hear

and the good old days taste so sweet
but they'll turn you around
tomorrow's coming, time is up
there's no slowing down

where have we been
together my friend
it's an uphill climb
together my friend

it's an uphill climb
together my friend

when the night is cold
and the hour is dark
standing alone
at your back and
by your side
everyone that you've known

where have we been
together my friend
it's an uphill climb
together my friend

it's an uphill climb
together my friend

it's an uphill climb
together my friend
it's an uphill climb
together my friend
it's an uphill climb
together my friend
it's an uphill climb
together my friend
Easy Riser

Star Bock Blues 

Tropical taxi dropped me off
at the Old Quarter in old downtown
Wrecks Bell cheered me up
after Starbucks shut him down

Rex has a mind for mischief
Mixed Lone Star and Shiner into something new
called it Star Bock and bought the trademark   filed the trademark
Add one more verse to Rex's blues

Time flies like an arrow
the mad dog was in his yard
Fruit flies like a banana
Jokers wild when you're playing cards

Do no harm you easy riser
The working dogs are gone today
A recipe for good feeling
I'm a lucky man is all he'd say

Time flies like an arrow
the mad dog was in his yard
Fruit flies like a banana
Jokers wild when you're playing cards

Do no harm you easy riser
lost your stash on a merry go round
your stash got lost on a merry go round
A recipe for good feeling
The working dogs are leaving town

All I need is shade & shelter
shield me from the storm today
my boots are wet from wading through
I'm a lucky man is all he'd say

Time flies like an arrow
Thought the mad dog was in his yard
Fruit flies like a banana
Jokers wild when you're playing cards

Rex has a mind for mischief
Mixed Lone Star and Shiner into something new
Same Old Vine

Ya don't have to be from Texas to feel like a Lone Star
I'm from a small state but I got a big heart
We might not wear the same hat, but I'll look you in the eye
I'm from the east, you're from the west
Both grew up on apple pie   a-a-f#-d

Red states and blue states maybe purples the answer
To make a good party it takes all kinds of dancers
There  are lines on a map – and lines on the road
We all got our own past and stories to be told

g
you say your roots go deeper than mine     Em/C
but we're all growing leaves on the same old vine  G /Em/D/G
g/em/D/g

From barbed wire on the border to the wall in berlin
you can build them up- but they´ll  fall down again
if you be Romeo  then  I'll be Juliet
we can re write the ending-h that they de serve to get

you say your roots go deeper than mine
but we're all growing leaves on the same old vine

gsolo <vamp<) 4 lines verse

you say your roots go deeper than mine
but we're all growing leaves on the same old vine
they get tangled angled  and intertwined
yea we're all growing leaves on the same old vine
I'm a mover, I'm a shaker
I'm a giver, not a taker
So I'm only gonna take   a few more minutes of your time
You look stressed, why don't you relax
I got an old remedy for that
I can tell from the look in your eyes, That this comes as a surprise
From the look in your eyes, I can tell it's a surprise but

I been there, I done that
I know him we go way back
Do you know so and so?
No you don't, well we're best friends
I can get you what you want
I can get you what you need
Have you heard of rock n roll
Yeah that was me

Take my advice it's solid gold
You can trust me cause I know
I've made millions man, let me tell you how it feels
You know earth moves 'round the sun
I know the guy who got it done
man we had a party the day they signed that deal
===

Man those were the days
In fact I coined that phrase
We had more good times back then than your mother would allow
Look at me, look at me, 
Look at me right now
It's fun to have fun, but you have to know how






Rings on a Tree v4

The cottonwood taught me how to listen to the wind
The willow showed me how to bend
The mighty oak taught me how to stand strong in a storm
And all that can become of an acorn

The cypress tree taught me how to hold on (make it) through the flood
Keep my roots deep and I won't budge
The pine tree taught me how to reach for the sky
The cedar showed how to lay low and get by when its dry

How I've grown, who I've come to be
These lessons learned, my history
Reads like the rings on a tree

[break]

Mother Nature's been my teacher all along
The rosewood on this guitar wrote this song
The sweet magnolia brought me love on a southern summer breeze
The giant redwood brought me to my knees

How I've grown, who I've come to be
These lessons learned, my history
Reads like the rings on a tree

And I've learned what's lost in the fall
brings new beginnings in the spring
and one more ring

[break]

How I've grown, who I've come to be
All the lessons, deep inside of me
Make me strong, like the rings on a tree

Onward v2

Today is the first day of the rest of my life
This moment cuts through the past like a knife
Got a bell to ring
Got a song to sing
Today is the first day of the rest of my life

Out of the old, into the new
Doors open, I'm walking through

Onward, brother, onward
Bigger better more
Onward, sister, onward
We're the ones we been waiting for

If not us, then who? If not now, then when?
To get where we're going, we got to begin
Yeah, it's a long road
And the going's slow
If not us, then who? If not now, then when?

The sun breaks through the gray
Oh tell me of an unclouded day

Onward, brother, onward
Bigger better more
Onward, sister, onward
We're the ones we been waiting for

Drops of water move a stone
All together now, not alone

Onward, brother, onward
Bigger better more
Onward, sister, onward
We're the ones we been waiting for

The only speakeasy in a hard neighborhood
She said "hanging round there, I know you're up to no good"
Singles and doubles, seven years aged,
A gentleman's playground, a working man's cage 
Say baby, what's so wrong
I'll be home by ten
I was seeking the spirits
I lost track of time again
Trouble came early, trouble stayed late
Trouble came early, trouble stayed late

I gotta good hearted woman, but she's ready to split
My baby she loves me, but she's tired of my shit ("so tired of this" -radio edit)
So I Hit the brakes, to Slow the Fast life down
It's too little too late, she's through hanging around
She broke my heart
when she broke the news
I give up
I've got nothing left to lose
Trouble Came Early, Trouble stayed late
Trouble came early, Trouble stayed late

I woke up faded with the hammerhead spins
I can't remember, did I fall, did I sin
Some call it justice, other's blackmail
It's the hair of the dog that keeps chasing his tail
The Cost so high
To live so low
I lost it all
but all I know   is that
Trouble Came Early, Trouble stayed late
Trouble came early, Trouble stayed late
Trouble to a Draw

Hungry wolves at my door
Every night there's one wolf more
Aooh  I can hear you
Crows all up in them trees
And I know you got your eyes on me
Yeah I can feel them

Chorus
It's like you can already taste my bones
I know it's your job not to leave me alone
It's the same game for us all
Trying to hold trouble to a draw

Snake in the shade playing hard to see
You'd be set for days, you get hold of me
I'm gonna step lightly
There's germs in the water, germs in the air
Germs everywhere
Just looking for a home

Chorus
It's like you can already taste my bones
I know it's your job not to leave me alone
It's the same game for us all
Trying to hold trouble to a draw

It's a midway walk past the carney's call
Knock the bottles down or lose it all
While you're trying to win that big stuffed bear
Your Exwives, the taxman, fire ants too
Down on the corner, they been asking bout you
Better take the long way home

Chorus
It's like you can already taste my bones
I know it's your job not to leave me alone
It's the same game for us all
Trying to hold trouble to a draw


Santa Rita

Drop D

There's drilling rigs on his homestead
Trying to find that oil
It might be trapped beneath the dirt
like a kettle about to boil

He's shooting at the rig lights
from his porch with a twenty two
whispering sons of bitches
what's it all coming to

Earth turns, the sun burns
Dirt on your hands
Holding on to the land

His great grandad used it raising cattle 
drove em all the way to Wichita
then they closed the range with the barb wire fence
made cotton farmers of them all

but farming don't pay when when the rain dont fall
and the burden fell hard you see
so he sold off the mineral rights to
to the big oil company

Earth turns, the sun burns
Dirt on your hands
Holding on to the land

What's lost when the oil was found
But you can't put it back into the ground

pumpjacks and trailers
they got their own locks on the gates
they're punching holes in the lower forty
twenty miles from the interstate

His says the checks they pay the taxman
on this sacred piece of earth
But dollars and barrels and tankers
to them that's all it's worth

Earth turns, the sun burns
Got dirt on your hands
Holding on to the land

Earth turns, the sun burns
Dirt on your hands
Holding on to the land

Eyes Wide Open

going through the motions
spend too many days up in my head
sometimes a notion calls to soak a moment in
and not roll on instead

take too much for granted
yeah I might as well be blind
I don't understand it
always rushing and rushing 
just to save up more time 

Running around right past the wildflowers
running down a road with no end
trading sunshine to bank one more hour
knowing I may never pass this way again
I don't want to be blindfolded
my time bought and sold
oh to live with eyes wide open
oh to live with eyes wide open

so many hard facts and hard truths
it's tempting to look away
for certainty and eternal youth
but this old world just don't work that way


gonna pull off at this riverbank
walk down to the water and put my toes in
breathe deep and give thanks
if not today then tell me when

Running around right past the wildflowers
running down a road with no end
trading sunshine to bank one more hour
knowing I may never pass this way again
I don't want to be blindfolded
my time bought and sold
oh to live with eyes wide open
oh to live with eyes wide open


Virginia and Hazel

Virginia Kelley played the phonograph
It was Mamie's 'Crazy Blues' 
"Getting all dolled up" she said
"My gams look GOOD in these shoes"
A car pulled up and honked
it was a breezer '24
she laid a kiss on her daddy's cheek
and scrammed on out the door
It was Hazel in the hayburner, 
and she pulled out the hooch
"Whattaya think, new Chaplin  
or the juice joint on the loop?"
Oh, Virginia

"To the gin mill" said Virginia 
Hazel said "you're on the trolley now!"
And she'll spend the next 4 decades
Living this night down
The girls turned every head
at the speakeasy saloon
"she's the berries, she's a bearcat " 
were the whispers in the room
Most were hard boileds and hoodlums
but two Jakes pulled up two chairs
they bought a couple rounds together
then they all headed out the stairs
Oh, Virginia

They peeled out of the parking lot
in a '28 Model A
they parked down by the river
it was a struggle buggy you might say
Each pair was neck and neck
when came a knock on the door
a strange man pulled a shiv
said, "bank's closed, get down on the floor"
He said "get out of the car, 
gimme all your jack
(if you) do just what i say (then) and you'll live 
to walk on back"
Oh, Virginia

The stranger stole the Model A, 
they had to ankle back to town
the sheriff pinched the pickled crew
for walking (wandering) drunk around
Virginia called her mom, 
Hazel called her dad
a forty dollar bail was set
things were looking bad
She never forgot her father's face
when he saw her through the bars
they didn't speak a word
on the ride home in the car

The light of Sunday morning
showed the shame on Virginia's face
at the Mineral Wells Baptist Church 
she sang Amazing Grace
That was Granny in the twenties
now she's pearls and powder blue
SECRETARY at the baptist church
And that's Hazel in the pew
That was Granny in the twenties
now she's pearls and powder blue
SECRETARY at the baptist church
And that's Hazel in the pew
Oh, Virginia
No Shortcuts

You can use duct tape and bailing wire
Or a two by four and a nail
Either way is gonna buy you time
But that duct tape is gonna fail

     There's no shortcuts on the long run 
     There's no easy way to get the job done
     There's no quick fix in the end, son
     No short cuts on the long run

You know the turtle beat the rabbit
Because the rabbit didn't try
You KICKED the golf ball into the fairway
We SAW you do it, don't look surprised

     There's no shortcuts on the long run 
     There's no easy way to get the job done
     There's no quick fix in the end, son
     No short cuts on the long run

Can't drive a racecar across the infield
Gotta go all-- the way around
Treat em good on the way up
You're gonna meet em coming down

     There's no shortcuts on the long run 
     There's no easy way to get the job done
     There's no quick fix in the end, son
     No short cuts on the long run

You gotta sit down with pen and paper
The song won't write itself
(And) When you're talking to the mirror
You can't blame nobody else

     There's no shortcuts on the long run 
     There's no easy way to get the job done
     There's no quick fix in the end, son
     No short cuts on the long run

     There's no shortcuts
     There's no easy way 
     There's no quick fix 
     No short cuts 

**maybe a call and response idea with the audience

     There's no shortcuts (on the long run) 
     There's no easy way (to get the job done)
     There's no quick fix (in the end, son)
     No short cuts (on the long run)
Made in the Shade

     In the shade, in the shade
     Lord I'm made in the shade
     For long hot days, I got paid
     I'm on my way, made in the shade

All week long I sold my time
Hundred dollar bill and a jug of wine
Wind off the hill and a big oak tree
Where the big old sun can't follow me

     In the shade, in the shade
     Lord I'm made in the shade
     For long hot days, I got paid
     I'm on my way, made in the shade

I've seen some things, I've been around
I've been on both sides of the town
Been sideways and in between
Let me tell you friend that all you need... is

     In the shade, in the shade
     Lord I'm made in the shade
     For long hot days, I got paid
     I'm on my way, made in the shade
     And I am made-- in the shade
Blueprint for Goodbye

Em

Your smile lines up in a perfect horizon
Curling at the edges getting closer to the sky
And I wonder what you're hiding
In all these photographs I've been finding

A timeline stretched out in digital space
Digital dust on a digital face
Two people     trapped in square
But no one's there

      C                  D
      Foreground, background
      Em                     C
      You're gone and I found 
      C                        D
      The blueprint for goodbye
	  Em
      in your eyes

An image of balance, forced symmetry
Ideal composition between your lips and teeth
It's just you and me-- developing--


      Foreground, background
      You're gone and I found 
      The blueprint for goodbye in your eyes
      in your eyes
Ask Her to Dance

Ask her to dance, look in her eyes
Take her hands, don't be too shy
This whole night may not turn on this one chance
But then again, ask her to dance

Just be yourself, you'll be alright
Stay loose and stay light
And if you're all alone, or you walk her home tonight
Just be yourself, you'll be alright

And if she says no, but she won't say no
But I guess there's always that chance
Just smile and say, thank you anyway
and later on, son, she'll give you this glance
If you ask her to dance

A step at a time, that's what we all do
Into this world, it's all waiting on you
And you'll stumble and slip and lose your grip
Then pull it all back in line- just in time
Just in time

So ask her to dance, look in her eyes
Take her hands, son, don't be too shy
This whole night may not turn on this one chance
But then again,
Then again,
Ask her to dance
Ask her to dance
Just be yourself
And ask her to dance
Hands of Time

I once walked golden halls
Old relics on the walls
I had it all
I'll find it again
I'll find it again

At It's such a height to fall
From stained glass windows tall
I had it all
I'll find it again
I'll find it again

Now that hell is over
There's a fortune in my mind
I'll steal my second chance from the hands of time
My thoughts are always sober
Even when I'm high
I'll steal my second chance from the hands of time

Out with the wind and waves
Making light of the darker days
I'm not afraid
I'll find it again
I'll find it again

I see color through the gray
What was dead has now been raised
And I'm okay
I'll find it again
I'll find it again

Now that hell is over
There's a fortune in my mind
I'll steal my second chance from the hands of time
My thoughts are always sober
Even when I'm high
I'll steal my second chance from the hands of time




Drought or Flood

If it's knee high by the Fourth of July, 
The corn will be just fine, come September
If that's true, there's nothing we can do
cause its the driest I can remember

Drought or flood, dust or mud
Heads or tails, loss or gain
Hey It comes on/up fast, but it never lasts
And I don't I mean to complain
But we could use a little rain

There are times that come to mind 
when the stars align in our direction
Money in the bank, water in the tank
we're giving thanks for perfection

It'll come around, I'll hear the sound
drops falling down on my windows
but as for today, I'm gonna stay
I'll just sway as the wind blows

Now it's knee high on the Fourth of July
and we'll be just fine come September




Churches and Cantinas

Am                                             E
She said a prayer to the virgin, crossed herself and sighed
E                                                           Am
Blew out a single candle, she held her loneliness inside
Am                                             E
One early April morning, so tired of being alone
E                                                                      Am
While walking through the market, she saw a man who worked in stone
E                                   Am
He builds churches and cantinas

He was chiseled from the finest flesh she'd ever seen
She longed to lay down in his arms with no prayer in between
At the church upon the scaffold he carves the hours away
She walks by and looks to heaven a dozen times a day
He builds churches and cantinas
He builds churches and cantinas

He pretends he doesn't see her,  (maybe) he guesses for her its just a game
But he'd give this whole cathedral just to hear her speak his name
Later on at the cantina in a crowd but all alone
While she's praying to the virgin, he's just praying for a home
He builds churches and cantinas
He builds churches and cantinas

C                               F
Gather your granite, Sharpen your tools
E                                           Am
You may know your craft but God knows the rules
C                                                   F
(He builds) churches and cantinas not so far apart
E                                                  Am
Both offer some redemption and sooth a lonely heart
E                        Am
Churches and cantinas
E                        Am
Churches and cantinas
Raise Up the Signal

He said welcome to the bar in the middle of nowhere
I stumbled through the door and walked on in
He said son looks like you been through the ringer
Sometimes you got to take one on the chin

I told him my sad tale of woe
He listened for an hour or so
He poured me one more shot of rye
Looked me straight in the eye

He said
Raise up the signal, cut down the noise
Set a good example for all the girls and boys
Do your work and spread your money all around
Learn to leather up, it's time to double down

He said listen, and you'd better listen good
He was the chisel and I was the wood
He carved me a perspective that I carry to this day
Never let your complaining stand in your way

He said
Raise up the signal, cut down the noise
Set a good example for all the girls and boys
Do your work and spread your money all around
Learn to leather up, it's time to double down

Are We There Yet?

Sitting in the back seat, Roy on the radio
Antique roadtrip, 120 miles to go
Quanah Texas Panhandle Saturday night
Motel 6 parking lot, they left on the light

you're twelve years old, all summer long
in a car with your parents, singing old (country) songs
windows barely cracked, daddy's cigarette burning
you're reading paperbacks in a used suburban

Are we there yet
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
All-- summer long

blue lit up swimming pool end of the day
pretty girl with her folks looking your way
game room with Pac Man, Donkey Kong too
Pocket full of quarters and Big League Chew

big green sign says its still a long way
100 miles from Dallas at the end of the day
Passed up the Dairy Queen twenty miles ago
It was on the wrong side so you're Daddy said no

Are we there yet
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
All-- summer long

(we're not even close, don't ask again
play a solo or something)

Twenty years later down the same old roads
'It's crazy how fast these kids have grown'
Now you're the driver you dont cut em any slack
you're trying to do it over while they're yelling from the back

Are we there yet
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
All-- summer long

In My Dreams

You walked out without warning, somewhere I don't know
And I've been walking circles, I try but can't let go
Even from a distance, you've got your way with me
I may not know where you are, but I know tonight we'll meet

    In my dreams you're here with me
    I close my eyes and I know where you'll be
    In my dreams that's where you'll find me
    Deep in the night in my dreams

The sun will rise tomorrow and I'll lose you again
It'll cut just like the first time so I'll kill time and then
I'll feel the sunlight fading, remember words you said
Count down every hour until I lay down my head

    In my dreams you're here with me
    I close my eyes and I know where you'll be
    In my dreams that's where you'll find me
    Deep in the night in my dreams

solo over chorus

    In my dreams you're here with me
    I close my eyes and I know where you'll be
    In my dreams that's where you'll find me
    Deep in the night in my dreams
    Deep in the night in my dreams

Wildflower

You can call her wildflower
You can call her wildflower
Seasons come and go too soon

Just a little wind she'll roam
Wildflowers don't make a home
With one smile from her, you're flying
Hold her if you can I dare you
Love her if you can I swear you'll
--- never regret trying

You can call her wildflower
You can call her wildflower
Pretty as a real good rain on a summer afternoon
You can call her wildflower 
You can call her wildflower
Seasons come and go too soon

(It was) good night moon, good night stars
Catching fireflies in jars
Yesterday she was my little girl
There's a dreamcatcher on her rearview mirror
Said it Helps her see the way clearer
--- Wherever she is in the world

You can call her wildflower
you can call her wildflower
Pretty as a real good rain on a summer afternoon
You can call her wildflower 
You can call her wildflower
Seasons come and go too soon

It's so hard to let her go
But she'll always find a place to grow

You can call her wildflower
you can call her wildflower
Pretty as a real good rain on a summer afternoon
You can call her wildflower 
You can call her wildflower
Seasons come and go too soon
Watch It Shine

I am one more pilgrim 
on this road low and high
Through this land of miracles
I've been traveling all night

I tangled with the darkness
I swear at moments I was blind
Til the dawn came up around me
And I could see the way unwind

	I am this road behind me
	I am the road ahead
	Lifted by this rocky ridge
	cradled by the river bed

	A harmony of motion 
	Through wide expanse of time
	Sunlight through the heavens
	Watch it shine
	Watch it shine

They say there's iron in this mountain
In bones, skin, and mud
They say iron can only come from stars
so stars are in my blood

Red and blue and purple
Shadows grow then fade
Spread in all directions
From where it all was made


French Vanilla

Clawfoot bathtub, natural high
Gamblers hat on the fourth of july
Homemade soap out in the woods
Sniffing paint mix it up good
with that French Vanilla

my little tramp , long road to nowhere 
aviators and a flower in her hair 
  wheat fields tractors, no billboard signs 
 tim horton's coffee smuggled over the line 
french vanilla 

bridge:
tonight's the night in a dirty white van 
listening  to levon sing with the band
  sound of her voice sure rings my bell 
smoke it up cuz you can't hide the smell 

in  thunder bay  you heard  willie p 
  you heard roger you heard me
 
3 staring at you, and a cow walkin
drag it through the garden, i heard you honkin
map out the window, geese flying south
sounds like cajun music coming out of your mouth
like French vanilla

in Lafayette we heard Clifton Chenier
in Martindale wrote a song for every beer
in Thunder Bay we heard Willie P
Something bout Blackie and the Rodeo King
drinking French Vanilla

Tonights the night in a dirty white van
listening to Levon and the band
smells so sweet feels like home
small comfort, never alone
French Vanilla

Maple leaf and the fleur de lis
Pot brownies and mushroom tea
what time is it, hey man come on
deliver flowers, write you a song
about French Vanilla
The Funeral Where Nobody Came

Eb
capo 3 in C

The snow brings the cold of winter my dear
Just a seam full of coal for Christmas this year
A pick and a shovel is an old ball and chain
The funeral where nobody came

Black ashes on faces, a pearl handle knife
From Harlan to Hazzard, from 18 to life
A caved in old mine, no stone with his name
The funeral where nobody came

Just a company preacher to pray for your soul
You can't beat the devil when you're down in his hole

The Ohio River runs full of rust
No song for a sinner, blackdamp and coal dust
No roses, no lilies, just the sound of a train
The funeral where nobody came

No roses, no lilies, just the sound of a train
A funeral where nobody came
Tools of Man

A 
capo 2 in G

desert floods and famine, sweat and blood and sand
they put all their faith in the tools of man
pyramids rose up, concrete was stacked
rising from the riverbed, holding mighty waters back

they could not see the future, brick by brick and stone by stone
they could not see wheels of progress moved by flesh and bone
stopped the flooding water, put power down the wire 
further on the neon jungle shined like elijah's fire

lift up your head, take my hand
pass along the tools of man

scaffolds ropes and shovels, against the mighty wrath of god
builders bear up stones, farmers break the sod
mix fire earth and water, plants from the ground came forth
a desert turned to garden, pushed southbound water north

lift up your head, take my hand
pass along the tools of man

an angel rests its wings, making up its mind
down on the nevada and the arizona line
pyramids in the desert will one day break and crack
falling to the riverbed, giving mighty waters back

lift up your head, take my hand
pass along the tools of man

Spring is all show biz, goes off like a riot
A season of passion that just won't be quiet
A chaos of color, flowers and weeds
Yeah, All the poets rave on and on about spring

And summer's a trail by fire, by furnace
A test of your faith and of dogged endurance
Sweat and black asphalt and sunburned skin
Somehow we made it through August again

To
A bouquet of pencils, sharpened and yellow
Fresh pile of leaves gathered up high
A breath of cool air, there on your pillow
From a window that's finally opened up wide
May all of these things help you remember 
That I love you more, more like September
  
And winter's a bore, slow and cold
Nights are too long with too many clothes
A still life picture all white and greys
Stuck locked inside not like today

But  
A bouquet of pencils, sharpened and yellow
Fresh pile of leaves gathered up high
A breath of cool air, there on your pillow
From a window that's finally opened up wide
May all of these things help you remember 
That I love you more, more like September






Extra lines
And the white hot insanity of July in Texas
Made clear what we need is all that we're left with 


Hey there girl I been thinking bout you
And missing the things we used to do
Anyway it's hard to see 
anywhere without you, next to me

Now there's one where there once was two
You hold a big piece of me with you
This kind of love I never knew
Changes every little thing I do

I'd hug you tight and kiss your face
I think of you all over the place
Red river flows and gulf wind blows
We made it through rocky mountain snows

Now there's one where there once was two
You hold a big piece of me with you
This kind of love I never knew
Changes every little thing I do

Hard to say, but even so
I need you is all I know
I'm hoping I do right by you
It's changing every little thing I do

Now there's one where there once was two
You hold a big piece of me with you
This kind of love I never knew
Changes every little thing I do

Hey there girl I been thinking bout you




 
I lost my way but I'm pulling through
My eyes are opened to a wider view
Open my eyes to a wider view
Try to lighten up and enjoy the view
Got my eyes open to a wider view
You opened my eyes to a wider view
Raise my eyes to a wider view
You show the way, a wider view
Swing wide the gate to a wider view
Your eyes are the ones I'm seeing through


You hold a big piece of me with you
This kind of love I never knew
Changes every little thing I do


Twists and turns my heart is going through
The rock and hard place we're going through







Like the sun rays dancing on the morning dew
Your love changed my point of view

Son are you weary, of the struggle in life
Do you take your heartache with a glass of wine
Are you haunted by the ghosts you know
Pay em off with diamonds, the debts you owe

Father are you tired, full of despair
Fish out of water, gasping for air
At the mercy of your troubled soul / At the mercy of the measure you hold
Prop up a ladder, pay your toll  / Trade off sawdust for silver and gold
Prop up a ladder, made out of gold

I'll tell you my gospel, sell you my truth
Been distilled over time, it's awfully smooth
Fix your religion, your political views
If you give it all to me I'll share it with you...
Give it all to me, trickle down to you

Mama come on and join me in the tower
Where kings and queens (pass out) hold the power
Break out the dresses and get in your suit  (and your suit)
Give it all to me I'll share it with you

Dm   G   Am   F

The wealth of the world has been compressed
With permanent hard times for the rest
But we're survivors, put to the test
We gave it all you, now share it with me

on the southeast side of Kansas on the hill on the edge of town
near the Cherokee Nation sits the house of Nancy Brown
a jewel box on the prairie can be seen from all around
peeling paint and faded glory of the house of Nancy Brown

From the mills of Ohio her husband rode the train
west to mine the heartland and to make himself a name
they punched a hole and more money came up from the ground
and he pointed to the hill where would build a house for Nancy Brown

	Sixteen rooms, sixteen columns, sixteen servants she can call
	but for a clapboard in Ohio she would gladly trade them all

Nancy read the telegram and couldn't stop the tears
It read 'come west at once our new life awaits you here'
her past and her present stuffed in boxes on the ground
labeled final destination: future home of Nancy Brown

Brown directed every detail, and every choice he made
His wife's departure from Ohio was deliberately delayed
All the wood was hand selected so no knots will be found
on the paneling and floorboards of the house of Nancy Brown

	Sixteen rooms, sixteen columns, sixteen servants she can call
	but for a clapboard in Ohio she would gladly trade them all

she could feel the eyes upon her as she stepped down from the train
not a word was spoken but they all knew her name
light reflected off her diamond as the sun was going down
like a castle like a tower sat the house of Nancy Brown

Winter turned to winter, the seasons never change
as the home was completed in the snow and in the rain
her husband was at the mine, the last shingle was laid down
echoing so hollow in the house of Nancy Brown

	Sixteen rooms, sixteen columns, sixteen servants she can call
	but for a clapboard in Ohio she would gladly trade them all
	Here she traveled to unravel like a watch that's come unwound
	trapped in barren beauty by the house of Nancy Brown

Standing on the balcony staring out towards the mine
Wondering if what he's looking for is what they came to find
And her sisters in Ohio have never come around
to gaze at the glory of the house of Nancy Brown

Preserved in her perfection is a photo on the wall
Black and white, stiff and starched, and staring down the hall
sometimes a ghostly light flows across the mansion grounds
barely noticed as in life at the house of Nancy Brown
barely noticed was the wife at the house of Nancy Brown





Welcome Back From the War

You'll see him walking past
His reflection in mirrored glass
Neon lights and an Irish grin
Come on in

Just like his dad did before
Harder drinking, back from war
Average Joe, flesh and bone
Welcome home

     Now you're back, you'll never be the same
     Already standing when they called your name 
     Medals stacked in a drawer
     Welcome back from the war

You shipped out, he was drafted in
Soldier's life circles round again
If you fought the fight like him
Come on in, Come on in

     Now you're back, you'll never be the same
     Already standing when they called your name 
     Metals stacked in a drawer
     Welcome back from the war
     Metals stacked in a drawer
     Welcome back from the war


Check the mirror, lay down the gun
The war in your head is never done
But you don't have to fight alone
Welcome home, welcome home

     Now you're back, you'll never be the same
     Already standing when they called your name 
     	Theres so much you're needed for   / So much that you're needed for
     Welcome back from the war
       door
     Welcome back from the war
     Medals stacked in a drawer
     Welcome back from the war

It's been all work and no play for this dull boy
I been saving up my money for a brand new toy, a brand new toy, a brand new toy
Purrs like a cat, and rings like a bell
Four round wheels and new car smell, I need a brand new toy
Another shot of joy
I been feeling blue, I know what to do
I need a brand new toy

I been shaking every tree in this town
I got a bobber in the water but it won't go down, a brand new toy, a brand new toy
My (laptop) computer's old I need one that's new
Tell me what kind (of laptop) did Shakespeare use
 I need a brand new toy
Another shot of joy
I been stuck, down in a rut
I need a brand new toy

I can play guitar, a pure sweet tone
but I can't get it out of the ones I own, a brand new toy, a brand new toy
I had dreams that died when Skymall closed
where'm I gonna get self ironing clothes, I need a brand new toy
I need a insect vacuum, I need a potato gun, a hat for my dog, I need a brand new toy

So many choices, so many roads
How'm I supposed to know which way to go, a brand new toy, a brand new toy
 I need a brand new toy
I need to grab that joy
I been feeling blue, I know what to do
I need a brand new toy




I can't get ahead and my luck's run dry
My father in law said I'm a okay guy, 






My way

A place to start and a place to go
A mind a heart and an open road
It can all go a million ways
That's what you get - and days

A fire at home and work to do
Some hard seasons to get through
some fly like arrows, some feel like a maze
a path wide and narrow - and days

	a sunrise a sunset
	where you've been, and what's not yet
	a chance to ride the light before it fades
	Thats what you get   and days

You make some turns, you grow and change
And everything around you will do the same
Life moves in circles, it moves in waves
Blessedly simple, you get days 

morning coffee turned drunken masquerade
this love hurts and nothing dulls the pain
broken bottles on the floor
no pictures in the frames no more
time to get away
and 

		go beyond yonder
		go beyond yonder
		
we said I do and lit the fuse one day
now what we had has all blown away
empty house open door
this aint my life no more
I'll
		go beyond yonder
		where love abides got a ticket to ride 
		everybody's dream, escape from everything
		and go beyond yonder    
               let's go beyond yonder    

beyond yonder is wild and free
beyond yonder -- in my dreams
at the bottom of the pain
a new picture in the frame
step up and feel
that the heart ache is real


		oh beyond yonder
		(Em) oh beyond yonder
		oh beyond yonder

Larry was a boy about six foot nine
He was the drummer in his brother's band
He never could keep very good time
But he owned his very own van
 
When their manager Duncan died of consumption
Larry took over the reins
And it wasn't too long 'til every dance hall
Had a marquee showing their name
 
	They were the famous Biscuit Brothers Band
	Riding around Tulsa in Larry Biscuit's van
 
Larry's brother Daryl was a singing fool
He thought he was the star of the show
But whenever Daryl asked to be turned up
Larry always told him "no"
 
Then after soundcheck at the Bottleneck
Daryl was a-nappin' backstage
When ol' Larry picked up Daryl's guitar
And tuned the B to an A
 
It was a sold out show and the crowd was hollerin'
For The Biscuits to start the first song
Larry counted it off, Daryl hit a chord 
And the crowd knew something was wrong
 
After it happened Larry was laughing
But Daryl was back at the house
His face was red and he was spittin' mad
And believe me he was workin' it out
 
	They were the famous Biscuit Brothers Band
	Riding around Tulsa in Larry Biscuit's van
 
The very next day at Tulsa Chevrolet
The Biscuits had a televised show
And Daryl loosened up all the wing nuts
On Larry's drummer's throne
 
When Larry sat down he fell all the way down
To the laughter of the TV crowd
And the words yelled as he fell
Channel 4 had to bleep out
 
Seven weeks later when Larry woke up
The doctors were scratching their chins
They said "the good news, Larry, is you're not dead,
But you may never play drums again"
 
A pretty nurse was humming a tune
And holding a pepsi can
She said, "weren't you the original dru`mmer
For the Daryl Biscuit Band?"
 
Yes it's the famous Daryl Biscuit Band
Riding straight to the top in Larry Biscuit's van

WHEN I HIT SAN ANTONE

This old skyline takes me back to another time
Years ago in San Antonio I was yours and you were mine
It's been awhile, I hope you're doing well
I'm doing fine as far as I can tell

I recall a Sunday by the Riverwalk
You and me just walking around
Music filled the evening air on the streets of old downtown
We guessed about the days to come, the laughter and the tears
Since that time so much has changed I haven't heard from you in years

When I'm passing through
I always think of you
Are you with someone, are you somewhere all alone
I think of you when I hit San Antone

Sometimes Lord you can't help but think what might have been
Would we do it all over, if we could do it all again
Sitting by that fountain is a sweet memory
When you pass by that fountain do you ever think of me

When I'm passing through
I always think of you
Are you with someone, are you somewhere all alone
I think of you when I hit San Antone

By the bank of the river, I held your hand
There was a distance even then that I couldn't understand
I loved you more than I'd ever loved before
I loved you though you said, I can't see you anymore

When I'm passing through
I always think of you
Are you with someone, are you somewhere all alone
I think of you when I hit San Antone
ME AND MARIA

I sent Maria North last summer, said I'd follow over soon
I'm reminded of my promise 'neath a yellow desert moon
I can hear the crickets song again it's time for me to go
Cross over the border get out of Mexico

By the bank I scan the darkness, watch the river rollin' past
I crouch down in the water hidden by the grass
And I wade that muddy river 'til I reach the other side
I scramble through the bushes and out into the night
And a foreign land is all that stands between me and Maria

I cross the line with her in mind my only chance to see her
I rush silent through mesquite brush, no thought of slowin' down
Movin' over the barbed wire fence I never made a sound
And I'd sent word to Maria where to meet me before dawn
I knew she would not fail me I prayed nothing would go wrong

So I inched across the fencelines and rushed across the roads
I was watching close for green and white I.N.S. Broncos
And at least I reached the crossroads before morning's light
Soaked with sweat and torn by thorns Maria nowhere in sight
And a foreign land is all that stands between me and Maria

So I hid off in the brush paralyzed by fear
I searched my brain for answers why Maria was not here
And the sky turned gray as dawn approached still I saw no sign
Of Maria down that long highway, I was running out of time

Then a flicker down the pavement dropped me to the dust
With the rush of tires on asphalt I looked out through the brush
And my heart leapt to my throat the patrol Bronco passed
I met the eyes of sweet Maria crying through the glass

I stood and watched them disappear speeding down the road
I walked out on the blacktop then turned my head to go
On the quiet early morning my heart heavy filled with pain
I crawled across the barbed wire headed back the way I came
And a foreign land is all that stands between me and Maria
TENNESSEE HIGHWAY

Tennessee highway, Tennessee highway
Take me home to see my Texas baby

I been in and out of every bar here in Nashville
Seen nothing but broken promises and empty dreams
Everyone here thinks they're on the verge of stardom
But nothing here is what it seems

Tennessee highway, Tennessee highway
Take me home to see my Texas baby

Now the Grand Ole Opry ain't playin in the Ryman
They moved it out of town, down the road a little ways
They say it's the same but I know something different
From old Hank Williams' days

Tennessee highway, Tennessee highway
Take me home to see my Texas baby

This motel room is filled with songs that don't ring true
And doing what I love don't make sense like it used to
Deep down inside I guess I always knew
This Tennessee road leads back to you

Tennessee highway, Tennessee highway
Take me home to see my Texas baby

(Owen Temple, Lendon Lewis)
DRY CREEK

Just a way down Mount Bonnel Road
There's a little place where the beer is cold
Dry Creek Café and Dock
No place better come five o'clock
Just off the lake a two story bar
You know you're there when you see the cars
Lined up and parked along
Jukebox playing a Guy Clark song

I want to go down to Dry Creek
Down among the live oak trees
No playing cards or leaving bottles around
You can sit on the deck and watch the sun go down

There's a weathered deck right upstairs
A few odd tables and rusty chairs
Spring days when the hills are green
The view beats all I've ever seen
Feel the Texas sun warm your skin
Ain't it good to be back again
People's voices with the swaying trees
Honeysuckles on a gentle breeze

I want to go down to Dry Creek
Down among the live oak trees
No playing cards or leaving bottles around
You can sit on the deck and watch the sun go down

Sara owns the place and she lives in a shack
A green trailer parked out back
High dollar condos are closing in
And she ain't thinking about giving in
Rumors go around with the offers they make
For the little piece of land there by the lake
She tells 'em all to go to hell
After fifty years she ain't gonna sell

I want to go down to Dry Creek
Down among the live oak trees
No playing cards or leaving bottles around
You can sit on the deck and watch the sun go down

So if you want to keep the bulldozers back
Stop and get a drink at the Dry Creek shack
Watch Lake Austin and the big blue sky
You won't ever have to ask me why

I want to go down to Dry Creek
Down among the live oak trees
No playing cards or leaving bottles around
You can sit on the deck and watch the sun go down
THE WANNA WANNA BAR

A seagull cry, a child laugh, an old man orders a drink
It's been ten years since he got here and it hurts to think
That years ago at this beachside bar a woman held his hand
He lost his chance for true romance on South Padre Island 

The woman's name was Mary Ann and Gary loved her so
He said be my wife for the rest of your life and she said no
Old Gary was from Indiana all his life a traveling man
He had a dog and a boat and he would float and fish around the island

He's stuck at Wanna Wanna the beachfront bar sipping on a Coke and rum
The tide rolls in his dreams die out waiting on a love that won't come
True love never will come

Years ago in California Gary loved a girl named Sue
She and three more wives told him lies when they said I do
And this last one took the money and the things Gary cared about
She took the dog and the boat, now he can't float 'cause she walked out

He's stuck at Wanna Wanna the beachfront bar 
Sipping on a Coke and rum
The tide rolls in his dreams die out
Waiting on a love that won't come
True love never will come

Gary looks out at the gulf and squints his eyes
He's thinking again of what might have been without them hard goodbyes
But Gary's got lots of stories about people and places he's been
Yeah, I've had a few of them good times too he said with a grin

He's stuck at Wanna Wanna the beachfront bar 
Sipping on a Coke and rum
The tide rolls in his dreams die out
Waiting on a love that won't come
True love never will come

And Gary's still down there on Padre a little sad but he's alright
If you head his way on some Sunday he'll drink with you all night

He's stuck at Wanna Wanna the beachfront bar 
Sipping on a Coke and rum
The tide rolls in his dreams die out
Waiting on a love that won't come
True love never will come
MARY

Like a summer wind I'm walking with you warm
Like a bay out on the ocean you can keep me from a storm
But now your face shows signs of coming rain
Mary what can I do to ease your pain

Mary I can't bear to see you cry
Mary wipe the tears out of your eyes
Say the word and I'll make it right
Mary you don't need to cry tonight

Like a ship movin' out to sea
The hurting in your eyes is plain for me to see
I've got the time to be with you awhile
So Mary dry your tears let me see you smile

Mary I can't bear to see you cry
Mary wipe the tears out of your eyes
Say the word and I'll make it right
Mary you don't need to cry tonight

You're as gentle as the waves rollin' in
And the time for me to go is coming once again
I won't be gone long just like the moon
Though you can't see me you know I'll be back soon

Mary I can't bear to see you cry
Mary wipe the tears out of your eyes
Say the word and I'll make it right
Mary you don't need to cry tonight
YOU NEVER CAN TELL

I spent several days thinking of the ways I'd say we're through
But when I let you go I didn't know that I still cared for you
But last Saturday night beneath the barroom lights I saw you out with him
And in a matter of time I changed my mind I wanted you back again

Who'd a thought that I'd be feeling sorry
I'd have guessed that I'd be doing well
Well I saw you and my piece of mind went to pieces
It goes to show with love you never can tell

Well I did not go to the rodeo but I heard you were there
Now the talk of the town is the love you found they say you're quite a pair
I thought wait and see you'll be back with me it's just a matter of time
But something's changed they say you've got a different way of smiling since you were mine

Who'd a thought that I'd be feeling sorry
I'd have guessed that I'd be doing well
Well I saw you and my piece of mind went to pieces
It goes to show with love you never can tell

Now it's lonely nights and neon light every day's just the same
Since a church room crowd gathered around to hear you change your name
So I sit and drink and sometimes think about getting out of town
But I never go 'cause you know she just might come back around

Who'd a thought that I'd be feeling sorry
I'd have guessed that I'd be doing well
Well I saw you and my piece of mind went to pieces
It goes to show with love you never can tell
JAMES' BLUES

James washed dishes at a barbecue place Fifth Street downtown
He'd get his pay and go next door to drink his money down
I was just getting started playing guitar when I met him there
I'd finish a song he'd clap his hands no one else would but he didn't care

He'd yell out play Whiskey River and I'd play it as best I could
I'd take a break and he'd say, man you're really sounding good
I shook his rough dishwashing hands, he said his name was James
He'd go back to playing that pool every evening the same old thing

He was drinking away every single dollar
I'd play the song that he'd holler 
He'd clap his hands and make everybody smile
No wife no kids just a job in Austin
No telling all that drinking cost him
I haven't seen James in awhile

James would ask the bartender for a ride home now and then
He said he lived a few blocks down at the Capitol Inn
The bartender dropped him off but James walked right on past
He didn't quit walking 'til he'd laid down beneath a busy underpass

He was drinking away every single dollar
I'd play the song that he'd holler 
He'd clap his hands and make everybody smile
No wife no kids just a job in Austin
No telling all that drinking cost him
I haven't seen James in awhile

James got drunker than usual and ended up in jail
The owner of the barbecue place came down and paid his bail
But when they got back to the place she said now James I got to let you go
James walked out that door forever and the rest nobody knows

He was drinking away every single dollar
I'd play the song that he'd holler 
He'd clap his hands and make everybody smile
No wife, no kids, no job in Austin
One more thing the drinking cost him
I haven't seen James in awhile
IF YOU CALLED

The lowering sun stretches shadows across the windy plain
I 'm thinking on the time that 's passed, how you never felt the same
When I said it 's hard to leave you said, it 's hard to watch you go
I shouldn 't have believed you, but back then how could I know

I'm trying hard not to love you
My heart don 't know that you don 't care at all
I say aloud that I do not need you
But I know I 'd come to you if you called

The moonlight down by the riverside must have played a trick upon my eyes
Cause I thought I saw forever with you, I could not realize
And I can 't stand to search this heart and find I still love you
And it hurts my pride to know I 'd take you back if you asked me to

I'm trying hard not to love you
My heart don 't know that you don 't care at all
I say aloud that I do not need you
But I know I 'd come to you if you called

I 'm trying to get you off my mind
But your love 's a memory I can 't leave behind

I'm trying hard not to love you
My heart don 't know that you don 't care at all
I say aloud that I do not need you
But I know I 'd come to you if you called
PASSING THROUGH
1999
DOWNTOWN

Downtown's all closed down
They've boarded up the windows
Just like an old ghost town
The storefronts are empty
There's no one around
Downtown's all closed down

A small town in Texas by the courthouse in the square
The middle of the afternoon, there's nobody there
Well I shook my head and wondered
Where all the businesses had gone
Used to be everything that you'd ever need
Now just the bank's still holding on

Downtown's all closed down
They've boarded up the windows
Just like an old ghost town
The streets are all empty
And there's no one around
Downtown's all closed down

The old drugstore is vacant
And the café's locked its doors
Movie marquis is falling down
There's no more hardware store
So I sat down on a bench
I watched a car go driving by
I wondered what had killed downtown
And how the people could let it die

Downtown's all closed down
They've boarded up the windows
Just like an old ghost town
The storefronts are empty
There's no one around
Downtown's all closed down

The railroad brought the people here
Now the interstate draws them away
It moved the steady business east
Left these old buildings behind to stay
But some folks in town remember
A time not too long ago
When a film called Casablanca played
At the town square picture show

Downtown's all closed down
They've boarded up the windows
Just like an old ghost town
The streets are all empty
There's no one around
Downtown's all closed down
DRIVING MYSELF CRAZY

I guess it's been some time
Since my feet been on solid ground
They've been hovering over the road
That my wheels keep rollin' down
And I bet you that these truckers
They must wonder who I am
To keep speedin' past 'em up the road
And heading right back down again

It's all that I can do just to keep it between the lines
The hum of the road keeps humming through my mind
After this many miles it all gets a little hazy
I've been here before I'm just driving myself crazy

A locomotive blowing smoke and glittering in the sun
Raced me by the road and I'm proud to say I won
But maybe I lost 'cause I don't know what its worth
To keep spinning these wheels along with the spinning of the earth

It's all that I can do just to keep it between the lines
The hum of the road keeps humming through my mind
After this many miles it all gets a little hazy
I've been here before I'm just driving myself crazy

The road is a raging river and I just follow where it leads
I don't pay too much attention to those old trucks in the weeds
Rusting at the junk yards on the outskirts of town
This old truck's still running, I got no time to slow it down

It's all that I can do just to keep it between the lines
The hum of the road keeps humming through my mind
After this many miles it all gets a little hazy
I've been here before I'm just driving myself crazy

(Owen Temple, Paul Lee)
CAN'T KEEP MY MIND OFF YOU

All night I tossed and turned
I couldn't sleep a wink
I laid there in the dark
I couldn't help but think
About those miles between you and me
Then I gave up on sleeping and I reached for my keys

I can't keep my mind off you
No matter where I go
No matter what I do
Even looking up at the sky of blue
I can't keep my mind off you

Rolling down a highway all alone
I hear Bob Wills playin' Rose my Rose of San Antone
And it's just me, there's no other cars
Riding in the dark with a windshield full of stars

I can't keep my mind off you
No matter where I go
No matter what I do
Even looking up at the sky of blue
I can't keep my mind off you

Now the sky around me turns a little gray
The sun is coming up bringing on a brand new day
As I wake you with the phone
I say you're startin' this day early
But you ain't spending it alone

I can't keep my mind off you
No matter where I go
No matter what I do
Even looking up at the sky of blue
I can't keep my mind off you
TREAT YOU LIKE I DO

I broke your heart one more time
I came home you were crying 
I love you babe you know it's true
But I can't keep from hurtin' you 
Cause I go out to those roadside bars
Livin' fast beneath the stars
And you just want your man at home
Or at least a call on the telephone

I don't know why I treat you like I do
It's got more to do with me than it's got to do with you

When that evening sun goes down
There ain't no doubt where I'll be found
Dim lights, a crowd, and a smoke-filled room
Forget I said I'd be home soon
And by the time I find our front door
You just can't wait up no more
You thought a man that cared for you
Could do the things you ask him to

I don't know why I treat you like I do
It's got more to do with me than it's got to do with you

Last night I came home you were gone
Lord knows I've done you wrong
I guess its time that I lost you
I'm sorry for the time I cost you

I don't know why I treat you like I do
It's got more to do with me than it's got to do with you
LIGHTS OF TOWN

The red sun's going down, I'll be waiting up again 
Wondering where you are tonight
Out with all your friends
And I guess that you don't think about
The home you left behind
But I'd give everything to get you out of my mind

You thought a quiet ranch road
Was good enough back then
But now you need those city lights and bars to go sit in
And I wonder where the old you goes
When all the bars close down
'Cause I can just listen to the crickets sing
but you need the lights of town

The lights of town are blinding you now
You can't even see
That part of you you left behind
When you walked out on me
But when those city lights go dim
and you're left all alone
I wonder if you could find
Your way back home

You forget about the moon in a bar full of neon lights
You can't remember holding hands
On chilly autumn nights
And though it seems to you
That the starts have lost their shine
They're glowing bright as ever darling
Past the city limits sign

The lights of town are blinding you now
You can't even see
That part of you you left behind
When you walked out on me
But when those city lights go dim
and you're left all alone
I wonder if you could find
Your way back home

In the middle of the night I sometimes watch the road
I see the headlights move on past
And I shiver from the cold
By now the doors are locked downtown
And still no sign of you
The lights of town have broke the heart
That loved you once so true

The lights of town are blinding you now
You can't even see
That part of you you left behind
When you walked out on me
But when those city lights go dim
and you're left all alone
I wonder if you could find
Your way back home
OPEN WINDOW

Through the open window I can hear a passing train
In the gentle wind I can smell the coming rain
I can tell its dusk by the shadow on the wall
But I don't know if you're in love with me at all

I can watch the sky and I always seem to know
Just before an old blue norther's gonna blow
I can tell that summer's giving was to fall
But I don't know if you're in love with me at all

Maybe you could show some kind of sign
And then at least I'd know that you never will be mine
Maybe you could say so I'd believe
That you love me and you're never gonna leave

With the winter wind the autumn leaves will fall
But I don't know if you're in love with me at all

Just before you go I'm gonna see it in your eyes
And I'll feel it in your gentle alibis
I'll hear it like that lonesome whistle's call
And I'll know you weren't in love with me at all
And I know you'll never be in love at all

LISTENING TO THE AM

I pulled out of Charleston West Virginia
In the middle of the night
I made it down to Nashville town
When the sun was shining bright
I'm headed out west on a four day run
And I've got to make pretty good time
I gotta make a living livin'
My life chasing down a broken white line

So I ride this road and I try to get where I'm going
A cup of coffee and thoughts of home are all that help
And I'll spend another midnight early morning
Listening to the AM and talking to myself

Now Kingman, Arizona's
Just three hundred miles away from old LA
And I stopped to take a nap in Flagstaff
But I've still got to drive all day
Now when the sun sets out on the desert 
You never seen such a beautiful sight
But at 2 AM in the desert man
You never seen a blacker night

So I ride this road and I try to get where I'm going
A cup of coffee and thoughts of home are all that help
And I'll spend another midnight early morning
Listening to the AM and talking to myself

I made it into LA
Just about the time I swore I had to get off the road
And I checked in to a motor inn
I turned the air condition way down cold
I slept all day then I woke up around about 10 PM
I grabbed a bite to eat at a little cafe
Then I hit the road again

So I ride this road and I try to get where I'm going
A cup of coffee and thoughts of home are all that help
So I'll spend another midnight early morning
Listening to the AM and talking to myself
HOUSE OF CARDS

	We live in a house of cards so tall
	It looks fine on the outside but it's bound to fall
	But the looking good is easy
	It's the feeling good that's hard
	And this house is just a house of cards

We've been bluffing each other for almost seven years
We both put on our best poker face
But inside we're filled with tears 
I bet our love and lost in too many other secret games
Now the love is spent and just the marriage remains

	We live in a house of cards so tall
	It looks fine on the outside but it's bound to fall
	The looking good is easy
	It's keeping it together that's hard
	And this house is just a house of cards

You wear a diamond but you've got a broken heart
We look like the perfect pair, but we're far apart
It just a matter of time until the shiny surface fades
And all that I've done wrong pays back in spades

	We live in a house of cards so tall
	It looks fine on the outside but it's bound to fall
	But the looking good is easy
	It's keeping it together that's hard
	And this house is just a house of cards

ONE LESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT

I was late for work
My boss is a jerk
He said don't let it happen again
But when I got my check
I said what the heck
I'll spend a weeknight out with friends
The last thing I recall
About the old dancehall
Was thinking I should probably get home soon
But at least I enjoyed becoming unemployed
I woke up at the crack of noon

	That's one less thing to worry about
	Work was a jail and I busted out
	Got time on my hands and there ain't no doubt
	That's one less thing to worry about

There was a new girl in town
And I seen her around
She was the prettiest thing I'd seen
I had a plan in mind
How to make her mine
At the fair out in Abilene
I won her a prize
And I looked in her eyes
I thought the love I saw there was real
But on a ride in the sky
She met another guy
Left me standing by the Ferris wheel

	That's one less thing to worry about
	Love is a jail and I busted out
	Time on my hands and there ain't no doubt
	That's one less thing to worry about
PASSING THROUGH

Flickering lights mean distant towns 
Rolling wheels make humming sounds 
The full moon makes the night like day 
A lonely road will make you feel this way 
When the town square's dark, the stoplights flash 
A midnight diesel rolls on past 
A northern front gives the air a chill 
I loved you then and I always will 

	I just roll the windows down 
	Passing through your hometown 

Up at the high school, there's no one in sight 
But they won their game on Friday night 
Now the lights are dark on the field of grass 
Where the hometown kid caught the touchdown pass 
Now the S.P. rail it makes a lonesome sound 
It splits the air and it shakes the ground 
Then it's swallowed up in the morning still 
I loved you then and I always will 

	I just roll the windows down 
	Passing through your hometown 

On the edge of town a store's lit up bright 
Gas pumps washed in fluorescent light 
The cashier nods and jerks awake 
At eight AM she says she'll take her break 
And now your town recedes in my rear view 
I've no idea what became of you 
The sun comes up on a distant hill 
I loved you then and I love you still 

	I just roll the windows down 
	Passing through your hometown
I WROTE YOU A WALTZ

You heard I was lonely 
I heard you were blue 
I heard a song in my head 
I wrote it down here for you 
It's nothing too fancy 
Just a few rhyming lines 
It's just something to tell you 
That you're on my mind 

	I wrote you a waltz 
	I wrote it so you could see 
	That I don't feel like dancing 
	Unless you're dancing with me 
	You know that I love you 
	Won't you give me your hand 
	I wrote you a waltz so that you'd understand 

We spent time together 
We spent time on our own 
I'm tired of spending my money 
On a long distance phone 
There's no doubt that with dancing 
Two's better than one 
So come on dancing partner 
The song's just begun 

	I wrote you a waltz 
	I wrote it so you could see 
	That I don't feel like dancing 
	Unless you're dancing with me 
	You know that I love you 
	Won't you give me your hand 
	I wrote you a waltz so that you'd understand 

RIGHT HERE AND NOW
2002
ACCIDENTALLY BREAK MY HEART

We've been tangled up like this before
Saying things we both regret
We dig in and start keeping score
We both forgive but we don't forget

It seems like nothing when it's going down
We've got to watch these words we throw around
We've got to stop this game before it starts
You might accidentally break my heart

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But a word could kill me dead
The body will mend whenever it bruises
But you can't take back a thing you said

It seems like nothing when it's going down
We've got to watch these words we throw around
We've got to stop this game before it starts
You might accidentally break my heart

Hearts get built up and broken with every word we say
Just saying we didn't mean it doesn't make it go away

So I'll tell you what I'm feeling truly
And not just react 'cause the stakes are high
A thousand words could lead us to forever
And a thousand more could lead us to goodbye

It seems like nothing when it's going down
We've got to watch these words we throw around
We've got to stop this game before it starts
You might accidentally break my heart
BURNING TOO HOT TO LAST

The first time I loved I didn't know how good that it could be
To have another heart see in you everything you hoped they'd see
If someone said the feeling wouldn't last there's no way I'd ever believe
That something I felt so true and fast could ever slip away from me

But the flames of passion burned it up
When early days of attraction passed
Like a meteor entering the atmosphere
Burning too hot to last

And I'm so tired of hearing that a burning heart is the only love that's true
And that the mystery of loving only lasts just as long as the love is new
Cause when the first part's done the real work starts
You get down and roll up your sleeves
The real trick is building an enduring love
The kind that don't ever leave

So the flames of passion can't burn it up
When early days of attraction pass
Like a meteor entering the atmosphere
Burning too hot to last

When the love's not tempered by a common trust, hearts can't take the strain
When the fire's all gone, what you got left is a smoky kind of pain

Yeah, the flames of passion can burn it up
When early days of attraction pass
Like a meteor entering the atmosphere
Burning too hot to last
LITTLE SWEET LOSS

She was smiling in the sun at a side street café
She had a love in her eyes and an ease in her way
Like her soul was lit up, her heart rung like a bell
I'll never know her name but I remember her well

People you're passing on the street
They're the friends you may never meet
And everybody's paid the cost
Of a little sweet loss

In a downstairs honky tonk, a kindly old gentleman
Sitting at a table alone, a picture of a dog in his hand
He wiped away a tear and I'll never know just why
What thought going through his head was enough to make him cry

People you're passing on the street
They're the friends you may never meet
And everybody's paid the cost
Of a little sweet loss

There's something going on forever in everything around
Connecting everyone, every sight and sound
I can see through a glass darkly but someday face to face
What do I hope to find by the end of this race

Looking out from a black and white picture that itself is fifty years old
Sitting at a desk in St. Louis talking on the radio
A girl at twenty five, she hopes to realize her dreams
She and I are not so different
There's just some time and space between

People you're passing on the street
They're the friends you may never meet
And everybody's paid the cost
Of a little sweet loss
THIS AIN'T LAS VEGAS

Look at you and me
We got two hearts
It's not a full house yet
Could be a pretty good start
There's no guarantees
In this hand that we play
We get to keep some cards
We have to throw some away

This ain't Las Vegas
We're not bound to lose
We can win it all
We've just got to choose
To bet on our hearts
We'll get to what's real
Cause we may not always know it
When we've got a good deal

It can make you crazy
Thinking 'bout hands that came before
And it won't help to worry
What shuffled decks have in store
Let's take what we know
And find a way how
To best play this moment
Right here and now

This ain't Las Vegas
We're not bound to lose
We can win it all
We've just got to choose
To bet on our hearts
We'll get to what's real
Cause we may not always know it
When we've got a good deal

I know you don't like gambling darling
But love's the only game in town
Let's put what we've got on the line
This kind of loving won't let us down
You and me take our chances
Draw 'em one at a time
Look there we got a match
That's makes us two of a kind
Let's raise our bet
And say a little prayer
'Cause no king or queen beats
A couple of hearts and a pair

This ain't Las Vegas
We're not bound to lose
We can win it all
We've just got to choose
To bet on our hearts
We'll get to what's real
Cause we may not always know it
When we've got a good deal
NO DARING IS FATAL

We looked for the perfect moment each and every night
Waiting for the timing to be just right
To say what we were feeling between us two
Both afraid of not hearing I love you too
Being in between loving is worse than no love at all
You can't keep walking along the edge of that wall
Got to jump one way together with all your heart
But we tried to keep walking 'til we fell apart

We were so close but so far away
'Cause our true hearts speak words that we don't say
A sure way of not getting what you're dreaming of
No daring is fatal in life and love

We've got one shot at life with no guarantees
We try to build a bridge to what we want to be
Dare to dream and dare to love
Dare to begin what you're thinking of
And our doubts are traitors and they make us lose
What we might win but for the fear to choose
All we can do is give it our best
And try to live life with no regrets

And we're so close but so far away
Because our true hearts speak words that we don't say
A sure way of not getting what you're dreaming of
No daring is fatal in life and love

Living is risky
A few things are certain
If we don't step on the stage
We might as well not raise the curtain

And we're so close but so far away
Cause our true hearts speak words that we don't say
A sure way of not getting what you're dreaming of
No daring is fatal in life and love
MOVE AROUND MONEY

Concrete and chrome, I'm spending time
Getting more of what's yours for less of mine
In fluorescent daylight above the ground
Nobody's life's made richer, money moves around
The transfer of wealth is the greatest good
Don't use imagination if you think you could
Art's by corporations, mass produced today
It's more uniform, consistent and it's faster that way

To move around money
Watch it fly
Move around money
Money never dies

Why bother living when you got TV
Easy as changing channels I know what I want to see
Who's got time to consider what it means to be free
I got sitcoms and commercials that's enough for me
I'm bought and sold, I'm glad I got the chance
To express myself with Gap khaki pants
I think I'll make a statement, I've got something to say
I use American Express when I'm asked to pay

Move around money
Watch it fly
Move around money
Money never dies

I know they care how I feel at my company
'Cause getting sad's bad for productivity
They say added value's what they really want from me
Since I was little is that what I hoped to be
This is the real world not make believe
If money doesn't make you happy then you'd better just leave
You got to make a living so that you can someday
Comfortably regret the life that slipped away

Move around money
Watch it fly
Move around money
Money never dies
Move around money
While you got your chance
Move around money
You can watch it dance
FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE

You called and said let's get together again sometime
You said that lately I'd crossed your mind
It's been a while since we've spoken
I'm pretty sure the last time our hearts got broken
We had something special once but now it's gone
Our lives intersected then we just moved on
I remember like a dream some beautiful days
Before we woke up and love slipped away

And I'd rather remember us the way it was then
Let's not even try to start things up again
The heat of old emotion would be too hard to fake
So let's not meet, for old times' sake

Let's not revisit the past face to face
It was a different time and a different place
Our hearts beat to the same rhythm way back then
But now there's some hurt we might bring up again

And I'd rather remember us the way it was then
Let's not even try to start things up again
The heat of old emotion would be too hard to fake
So let's not meet, for old times' sake

We'd just catch up on the basics then have nothing left to say
I'd rather remember you another way
I don't want to see your life's just fine without me
I'd like to keep a hold on old memories

And I'd rather remember us the way it was then
Let's not even try to start things up again
The heat of old emotion would be too hard to fake
So let's not meet, for old times' sake
BEFORE THE NIGHT BECOMES THE DAWN

Before the night becomes the dawn
I'll be beside my only one
Baby knows that when its dark I'm gone
But I'll be back before the night becomes the dawn

I travel up the road with songs to sing
And baby waits at home and wears my ring
She knows that I'll be back just when I can
Baby says she's glad that I'm her man
She understands just why I've got to go
Though she says there's times she'll miss me so
So I don't have extra time to hang around
Cause I know that she's at home in another town

Before the night becomes the dawn
I'll be beside my only one
Baby knows that when its dark I'm gone
I'll be back before the night becomes the dawn

You can make friends out of strangers anywhere
And in any place you can find someone who'll care
A hundred things to do and places you can see
But I'm thinking 'bout that girl that waits for me
You can't make yourself at home in some motel
So when I call to say if things went well
She asks if I'll stay out of town tonight
And I tell her I'll be there by morning's light

Before the night becomes the dawn
I'll be beside my only one
Baby knows that when its dark I'm gone
I'll be back before the night becomes the dawn

By the time the sun has made its trip around
In that bayou city I'll be found
As the shining sun reflects across the sea
In her loving arms is where I'm bound to be

Before the night becomes the dawn
I'll be beside my only one
Baby knows that when its dark I'm gone
I'll be back before the night becomes the dawn
TROUBLE WITH YOU

What you got is not what you wanted
And what you don't have you think you need
It's a daily human drama
Of insecurity and greed
All that matters is what you're chasing
What you've caught before is out of mind
For the chance to catch what's just out of reach
You'd gladly leave the rest behind

Well you're heading for trouble
And your heartache's 'bout to double
Why can't you be true
That's the trouble with you

There's no such thing as satisfaction
There's no real security
We've got the here and now and maybe tomorrow
The rest is all history
It's what's written in the hearts of others
That's what we should be thinking of
The sum of life's experience
Is the way you treat the ones you love

You're heading for trouble
And your heartache's 'bout to double
Why can't you be true
That's the trouble with you

All you want is everything
And nothing less will do
Just a little bit more of everything
That'll be enough for you

You're heading for trouble
And your heartache's 'bout to double
Why can't you be true
That's the trouble with you
THE MADDER YOU ARE (THE CUTER YOU GET)

Don't try and look so tough
I know what you're trying to do
You think you have to put on a show
For me to pay attention to you
Well baby you've got the floor
And I'm all eyes and ears
You don't have to act angry
For me to say what you want to hear

Oh Scarlet I give a damn now you can act your age
Bravo I love you now you can come offstage
Though I hate to see you simmer down
Even a little bit cause a girl good looking as you
The madder you are, the cuter you get
The madder you are, the cuter you get

Now your blues eyes are flashing
And your cheeks are getting red
And I can tell that I'm not helping things
With the clumsy words I said
I think I understand where you're coming from
I know what you want me to do
You're pretending to still be mad at me
I'm falling more in love with you

Oh Scarlet I give a damn now you can act your age
Bravo I love you now you can come offstage
Though I hate to see you simmer down
Even a little bit cause a girl good looking as you
The madder you are, the cuter you get
The madder you are, the cuter you get

Cool off the drama, how did this begin
What got you so excited so I can do it again
Sometimes I think that lovers
Really enjoy the little tests of will
You love to give me your advice
And I love to give you a thrill
And I guess it's nice to get crossways
Cause sometimes we both can win
The best part of a good clean fight
Is patching things back up again

Oh Scarlet I give a damn now you can act your age
Bravo I love you now you can come offstage
Though I hate to see you simmer down
Even a little bit cause a girl good looking as you
The madder you are, the cuter you get
The madder you are, the cuter you get
FAITH WITHOUT WORKS

What am I doing with my days
I can spend my time so many ways
Work I could do running through my head
But faith without works is dead

There is a meaning you can find
In every action, heart and mind
Uncover this, I thought I heard it said
Cause faith without works is dead

Once I'd seen my reflection in the glass
I could not forget it and walk on past

There is a truth written by a hand
Read it in the sea and sky and land
I'll walk and labor where I'm led
Cause faith without works is dead

We can build cities made of stone
Or we can help a lost heart home
Cities don't last as long as words you said
And faith without works is dead

I heard a perfect law of liberty
Love's the only work that can make us free

There is a work you need most to do
And there is work the world needs most from you
The place where you get both is where you are led
And faith without works is dead

YOU WANT TO WEAR THAT RING

A friend asked me before his wedding day
Tell me the truth I want to hear you say
Is marriage a blessing or is it a curse
I said, it's for better and for sometimes worse

You're gonna be happy and sometimes so sad
It feels good except when it feels bad
And you'll know that you don't know a thing
But day after day - you want to wear that ring
You want to wear that ring

It's hell when the two of you can't agree
It's heaven just being with your family
Growing hurts, but you grow and thrive
Through it all you feel so alive

You're gonna be happy and sometimes so sad
It feels good except when it feels bad
And you'll know that you don't know a thing
But day after day - you want to wear that ring
You want to wear that ring

He asked will I love her more or will I love her less
And with all my heart I answered yes
You'll take a ring and a ring you'll give
Before you die you will surely live

You're gonna be happy and sometimes so sad
It feels good except when it feels bad
And you'll know that you don't know a thing
But day after day - you want to wear that ring
You want to wear that ring

Why the all the questions
Man you already know

You're gonna be happy and sometimes so sad
It feels good except when it feels bad
And you'll know that you don't know a thing
But day after day - you want to wear that ring
You want to wear that ring

RED WINE AND TEQUILA

Sipping wine then taking shots is a stupid thing to do
Last time I felt this bad, I was spending time with you
Drank red wine and tequila now I'm hanging on the floor
I've got a sick feeling, we can't do this anymore
So I called to say goodbye, I can't argue on the phone
I tried to love you baby but we're better off alone

Like red wine and tequila, we're a bad combination
All we feel together is sick frustration
I've got some rough edges and you're smooth and refined
We do alright apart but we're terrible combined
We should have known better now it feels like hell
Red wine and tequila, baby - we don't mix well

You're sophisticated, always had a lot of class
You take things slow and steady, sipping wine from a glass
I was born impulsive, always got a new plan
I drink a shot of liquor soon as it's in my hand
If I make it through this, I swear to all my friends
I have learned my lesson, never mix with you again

Like red wine and tequila, we're a bad combination
All we feel together is sick frustration
I've got some rough edges and you're smooth and refined
We do alright apart but we're terrible combined
We should have known better now it feels like hell
Red wine and tequila, baby - we don't mix well
SWEAR IT OFF AGAIN

The lights in the arena and the crowd in the stands
Fifteen hundred pounds of bull gripped tight in your hands
Announcer says your name and the crowd goes wild
I've had rodeo dreams since I was a child

I ride in a rodeo a few times a year
I get stomped and bucked and then
I ride enough, I get muddy and bloody
Then I swear it off again

I've been trampled and broken and left in the dirt
Cheered by fans through ten years of hurt
Now I hung up my number, there's a ranch that I run
Where a man can make a living working out in the sun

I ride in a rodeo a few times a year
I get stomped and bucked and then
I ride enough, I get muddy and bloody
Then I swear it off again

My rodeo buddy he's doing real good
He's holding on longer than they thought that he could
He's got a chance in Vegas at the glory and wealth
Some nights I wonder could I do it myself

I ride in a rodeo a few times a year
I get stomped and bucked and then
I ride enough, I get muddy and bloody
Then I swear it off again
TWO THOUSAND MILES

See that U-haul truck filled with all that we own
Parked in the driveway of our old home
To cross this country by tomorrow night
We're gonna hit the road in the morning light

In a truck full of dreams
And a handful of doubts
But we put fear away
After we pulled out
Cause there's nothing we can't do baby
No problem, no trials
Two lovers, two days,
And two thousand miles

With you on one side and me driving on the other
Nothing's comes between us, two young lovers
We'll point this truck straight through the country's heart
Go thousands of miles from where we start

In a truck full of dreams
And a handful of doubts
But we put fear away
After we pulled out
Cause there's nothing we can't do baby
No problem, no trials
Two lovers, two days,
And two thousand miles

Yeah you and me baby we passed a test
Hauling these two hearts across the Midwest
Our friends called us crazy you know they were right
Crazy in love as we drove out of sight

In a truck full of dreams
With a handful of doubts
But we put fear away
After we pulled out
Cause there's nothing we can't do baby
No problem, no trials
Two lovers, two days,
And two thousand miles
LIKE WE STILL CARE

I go the other way if I see you first
And I know you do the same
I didn't think I'd see you out tonight
'Til I heard someone speak your name

But we don't want to talk
We don't want to share
We go through the motions
Just like we still care
Like we still care

I force myself to look okay
You do your best to smile
When I asked how have you been
We visit for awhile

But we don't want to talk
We don't want to share
We go through the motions
Just like we still care
Like we still care

Then I look out the window
And you reach for a light
The silence comes back colder
And it won't let go tonight

We don't want to talk
We don't want to share
We go through the motions
Just like we still care
Like we still care

You stand there smoking silent
And I move down the hall
I step outside in darkness
I promised you I'd call

We don't want to talk
We don't want to share
We go through the motions
Just like we still care
Like we still care
CAN'T DRINK ENOUGH TO SING

Dale was painfully shy back in high school
But he worked up the nerve bought Carla a ring
He hits the open mic every Friday
But he can't drink enough to sing

His momma said he shakes his leg like Elvis
His daddy said he does no such thing
He hits the open mic every Friday
But he can't drink enough to sing

And Carla says
Honey would you like another whiskey
I'd love it if you'd get up on that stage
Honey I know you think singing's risky
But you've written out the lyrics on a page

Sweat drips off his brow into his bourbon
With just the thought of banging on them strings
He hits the open mic every Friday
But he can't drink enough to sing

Carla huffs and comes on to the waiter
She looks around and fiddles with her ring
She hits the open mic with him Fridays
But he can't drink enough to sing

And Carla says
Honey would you like another whiskey
I'd love it if you'd get up on that stage
Honey I know you think singing's risky
But you've written out the lyrics on a page

Dale wakes up face down on his momma's driveway
With tore up lyrics and a thrown out ring
He won't hit the open mic next Friday
'Cause he can't drink enough to sing

And his momma says
Honey would you like another whiskey
She'll love you if you'll get up on that stage
Honey I know you think singing's risky
But you've written out the lyrics on a page
Dale was painfully shy back in high school
But he worked up the nerve bought Carla a ring
He hits the open mic every Friday
But he can't drink enough to sing

I JUST CAN'T QUIT LOVING YOU

I quit smoking I quit drinking
I quit staying out all night
I quit drinking from the milk carton
I quit starting barroom fights
But there's one habit that I don't want to lose
I just can't quit loving you

I quit paying my bills late
I quit driving cars too fast
I quit wasting my good money
On thrills that wouldn't last
But I can't stand the thought if you and I were through
I just can't quit loving you

Love is harder on me
Than anything else I find
Messes with my heart, messes with my mind
I guess I'll have to live with the love I have to do
I just can't quit loving you

When things got rough at work
And I kept at it for awhile
But when I'd finally had enough
I quit Johnny Paycheck style
But I'm still around after all that we've been through
I just can't quit loving you

Love is harder on me
Than anything else I find
Messes with my heart, messes with my mind
I guess I'll have to live with the love I have to do
I just can't quit loving you

I can't take any steps
To leave behind your heart
Without falling down honey
Or falling apart
And walking away is something I could never do
I just can't quit loving you

Love is harder on me
Than anything else I find
Messes with my heart, messes with my mind
I guess I'll have to live with the love I have to do
I just can't quit loving you
DEMOLITION DERBY

Racing down a track, a collision course
If we crash neither one will survive the force
Ramming into each other, fighting over the lane
We'll both be twisted metal and a bent up frame

Slamming into each other but the wheels are still turning
We used to be lovers demolition derby
Engines overheating, hearts taking a beating
We used to be lovers demolition derby

The last one to break apart wins
But neither one will live to love again
We trash each other like backroad punks
Perfectly good love becomes a pile of junk

Slamming into each other but the wheels are still turning
We used to be lovers demolition derby
Engines overheating, hearts taking a beating
We used to be lovers demolition derby

Who better to tear the other apart
Than the one who knows the secret places of the heart
We know how to hurt each other so when love goes bad
The one who used to make you so happy is gonna make you so sad

We could end this race and call it a draw
Call it a day before we wreck it all
Seems like a waste when we've got a clear head
All for bragging rights when love is dead

Slamming into each other but the wheels are still turning
We used to be lovers demolition derby
Engines overheating, hearts taking a beating
We used to be lovers demolition derby
YOU DON' T HAVE TO BE LONELY

When you come how from work - dark house noone's there
You might think that nobody cares
If the telephone won't ring and no message is waiting
You can't say that hope for love is fading

If you don't want to be alone
You don't have to stay at home
Someone else is out there you are not the only
One who hates to be lonely
You don't have to be lonely

When he saw her out one night, he said to himself
I bet she's here to meet somebody else
But a friend introduced her and a year later to the day
Down on one knee he took her hand to say

If you don't want to be alone
You don't have to stay at home
Someone else is out there you are not the only
One who hates to be lonely
You don't have to be lonely

But time passes and seasons change

They shared the same address and name but they lived separate lives
It's a thing that can happen to husbands and wives
They hadn't spoken for two weeks unless it was to shout
When she asked him to think of moving out

If you don't want to be alone
You don't have to stay at home
Someone else is out there you are not the only
One who hates to be lonely
You don't have to be lonely

THE PLUTO BLUES

I heard what happened, what they did to you
I read it in the paper, could not believe it was true
Scientists all met up as I understand it
They changed their minds one more time, now Pluto's not a planet

Pluto was once every astronomer's dream
A few decades later, nothing's sacred it seems
Now it lost its place in the planetarium set
In orbit for centuries - the thanks that you get

Today's star is tomorrow's black hole
Fame in the solar system is a dangerous goal
One day you're a planet, next day just a rock in space
Left in the cold, fallen from grace

He was the star of TV's Diff'rent Strokes
Once people the world over were laughing at his jokes
He made millions of dollars with his trademark phrase
But it all went downhill after those glory days
The TV show was cancelled, they said he wasn't funny
Then he found out his parents spent all of his money
Now he's doing his best as a security guard
He never thought the acting gig would ever be this hard

Today's star is tomorrow's black hole
Fame in Hollywood is a dangerous goal
One day you're a star, next day you're just a rock in space
Left in the cold, fallen from grace

And I know it isn't fair, celebrity's no gentle game
You haven't got it made when everybody knows your name
You may think your place in the stars is for sure
A trip from the top to a rent-a-cop can make you feel insecure

So take a lesson from former planets and former stars
You might dream someday everybody knows who you are
But astronomers are a fickle bunch, and the public just gets bored
You might wake up to find you're not a planet anymore

Today's star is tomorrow's black hole
Fame in Hollywood is a dangerous goal
One day you're a star, next day you're just a rock in space
Left in the cold, fallen from grace
RIVERS RUN FROM MANY WATERS

My great grandfather was a rake and a rambler
Good with the women but not a good gambler
Bet away a fortune, and lost a family business
Deep in East Texas, he died with no witness
A son of a son, a father of fathers
Rivers run from many waters

My grandfather could be called a free thinker
A poet, a painter, a pretty heavy drinker
He'd show me his workshop on Galveston Island
We'd go watch the ocean, he was a kind man
A son of a son, a father of fathers
Rivers run from many waters

My father tells me, that he's born again
Says he's not lonely 'cause Jesus is a good friend
Dad comes to visit and we get to talkin'
Get past the tension when he first walks in
A son of a son, a father of fathers
Rivers run from many waters

I can hear him when he wakes up and I fix his breakfast
Take him on school days, help him to get dressed
Everyday he's bigger, learning all that he can
Says he'll be a daddy when he's a grown man
A son of a son, a father of fathers
Rivers run from many waters
ON THE LONESOME ROAD

Well I've rambled coast to coast seen the cities of the plains
Where they know my face but they don't know my name
I made music and whiskey in the hills of Tennessee
I forget more places than most folks ever see

On the lonesome road I'm headed down
The highways roll from town to town
Just keep movin' on but might come back someday
I've got miles to travel and a heart full of songs to play

If I had a dollar for every song I've played
I'd bet you a dollar that my bills would all be paid
If I owed you a dollar for every love I lost
Don't show me the tab I can't bear to know the cost

On the lonesome road I'm headed down
The highways roll from town to town
Just keep movin' on but might come back someday
I've got miles to travel and a heart full of songs to play

When I get weary, I wonder where to go
When the road gets dark and the nights get cold
I want to find a place where restless souls like me
Can hear an old fiddle tune and a harmony

On the lonesome road I'm headed down
The highways roll from town to town
Just keep movin' on but might come back someday
I've got miles to travel and a heart full of songs to play
DOLLARS AND DIMES

BROKEN HEART LAND

How did your past get stuck in a pawnshop
Seems everything you owned is held in hock
At the only store open on this whole downtown block
On a shelf next to records and pistols
I found your old guitar
I saw your Chevy Nova down at the salvage yard

We got heartaches all around
Got miles of rusted towns
I sit back and wonder how it all slipped through your hands
Factories crumble away
Like the long gone glory days of a broken heart land

Down in the alley by the warehouse
I found a painting on a wall that you did
You wrote your name in letters six feet high
So there's no mistaking this is where you lived
The dreams you had
Thought they would all come true
But they just faded out like this old picture you drew

We got heartaches all around
Got miles of rusted towns
I sit back and wonder how it all slipped through your hands
Farmland just blows away
Like the long gone glory days of a broken heart land

So I threw your old guitar off the bridge into the river
Driftwood taking on water slipping away

We got heartaches all around
Got miles of rusted towns
I sit back and wonder how it all slipped through your hands
Farmland just blows away
Like the long gone glory days of a broken heart land

BLACK DIAMOND

There's nothing sadder than an empty sidecar,
A train with no engineer
The cop in this town, he hates Elvis, 
He's hanging from my rearview mirror
But he never sees it, he's usually drinking beer
Leaves his patrol car parked down here

In Black Diamond
Where the mountains begin and end
Black Diamond
Never one to fit in

My neighbor is a veteran, he's got a doberman
He named her Hope
His pension's guaranteed, but he sells the kids weed
And tells dirty jokes
My sister's in the beauty shop, wants to move on
She's tried to leave but she never stays gone

From Black Diamond
Where the mountains begin and end
Black Diamond
Never one to fit in
Black Diamond
For a Rocky Mountain ring
Oh Black Diamond
I can hear em sing

It's too late now to start again
You always look smarter with your shirt tucked in
Caught between the tables and the jukebox
Between fireworks and let there be rock
Shooter nights and chicken wings
The kids around here will dance to anything

But there's nothing sadder than an empty sidecar,
A train with no engineer
The cop in this town, he hates Elvis,
He's hanging from my rearview mirror
Like the one eared wolf with a green dragon smile
Pour another shot I'm gonna be here awhile

From Black Diamond
Where the mountains begin and end
Black Diamond
Never one to fit in
Black Diamond
For a Rocky Mountain ring
Oh Black Diamond
I can hear em sing

MAKING A LIFE

Waitress in a pink dress
Works before the sun's up
Barely pays the rent
Pouring coffee into coffee cups
To wake the truck drivers up
Then out on the interstate
He's out in a traffic grind
Got to keep the rig safe
Cause he's got a family to keep in mind
And man that's the bottom line

Getting by making the ends meet
Do what it takes to stay on their feet
Not gonna give up, not gonna give in
Making a life, not just a living
Making a life, not just a living

In an office building downtown
He's wearing a suit and tie
He could make more money
If he wasn't such an honest guy
But some things money can't buy
In a flower shop downstairs
She'll close it up early today
She might lose some business
But there's no price she wouldn't pay
To see her daughter's part in the play

Getting by making the ends meet
Do what it takes to stay on their feet
Not gonna give up, not gonna give in
Making a life, not just a living
Making a life, not just a living

And the flowers on the dashboard
Are hangin' low
Life's burning like a flashbulb
But dying slow - dying slow

Getting by making the ends meet
Do what it takes to stay on their feet
Not gonna give up, not gonna give in
Making a life, not just a living
Making a life, not just a living

CITY OF THE KING

I heard they named St Louis after some French king
She said she's name's Marie after the last French queen
The city of the king comes callin' when the sun goes down
But she only likes to call me when no one comes around
The lights on the river shine like a diamond ring
But I haven't got ten dollars in the city of the king
She's bruised behind the make-up painted on her face
Another man, another night, another spaded ace
More pain she can't erase

I may be just a jack but I treat her like a queen
Give her only love in the city of the king
One day the Mississippi will wash over everything
In the city of the king

Bottles on the table, dagger shining clean
East side Sunday mornings in the city of the king
We play a game of hearts when times for her are slow
I tell her that I love her but she only says I know
One night I came by saw a man with Marie
Fear behind her tears for the city of the king
I saw him raise his fist for the last time I swore
I cut him with my knife, left him bleeding on the floor
I can't come back here no more

I may be just a jack but I treat her like a queen
Give her only love in the city of the king
One day the Mississippi will wash over everything
In the city of the king

I laid low down in Memphis and for a time in New Orleans
Waitin' to return to the city of the king
But news rolled from upriver hit me cold like lead
Marie told folks she'd killed a man
Then they found her dead
In the river dead

I may be just a jack but I treat her like a queen
Gave her only love in the city of the king
One day the Mississippi will wash over everything
In the city of the king

DOLLARS AND DIMES

As a kid in Arkansawyer I got my hambone on
But those days are gone
To get me paid some wages, I rolled out of town
Where I find work is where I'm bound
Indy to Atoka, on roofs and under cars
Building churches, building bars
Tampa to Kalkaska picking fruit off of the trees
Michigan to the Florida Keys

Trying to find, trying to find
Dollars and dimes
Trade my time, dollars and dimes

No pie in the sky when I go
Old Utah Joe he ought to know
From Desolation Canyon to Confusion Range
I'm broken down feeling strange

Trying to find, trying to find
Dollars and dimes
Sell my time, dollars and dimes

Cairo Illinois you better watch out son
Like the Union Army never won
Two rivers join together Mississippi and Ohio
But stay apart as they flow

Trying to find, trying to find
Dollars and dimes
All my time, dollars and dimes

As a kid in Arkansawyer I got my hambone on
But those days are gone


(Owen Temple & Adam Carroll)
MEMPHIS

She was seventeen left Arkansas moved here on her own
After mom's boyfriend and a tornado tore up her home
She brought her small dog with her but she left behind her old clothes
She emptied out albums of pictures by the side of the road
She'd make some money then she would leave
But Memphis is not what it used to be

She got a job in Memphis cause she lied 'bout her age
Said she'd give it a try up on the stage
At the Platinum Plus club she was dancing
Dancing to the drugs and the music
If her body was a weapon, she had learned how to use it
So give her the money if you wanted to see
Memphis is not what it used to be

She made three thousand a week in that East Memphis club
Til' the Fed's shut it down for running drugs
Then the money got tight but she's got a solution
She and some of the girls next summer moving down to Houston
I asked her, what else in town should I see
She said Memphis is not what it used to be
LOS ANGELES

It's low, it's brand new, it's sprawling
Without center, gasoline powered, crawling
Dams and powerlines made the desert disappear
Now there's millions of people living here
It's paradise and hell all smashed together
Danger and glamour and good weather
Los Angeles is the city of the future
And it's coming to get you

Hell or heaven depends on the zip code
Don't find yourself on the wrong side of the road
'Cause devils and angels sleep under the 101
Runaways with nowhere left to run
Like an antique California postcard
A house with an orange tree growing in the yard 
Los Angeles is the city of the future
And it's coming to get you

You found a way to make the promise land reappear
Sitting in the dark beneath the pier
You finally made it to the Hollywood Bowl
Then wrapped a car 'round a Wilshire telephone pole
It's low, it's brand new, it's sprawling
Without center, gasoline powered, crawling
Los Angeles is the city of the future
And it's coming to get you


(Owen Temple)
I DON'T WANT TO DO WHAT I DO

This lawyer hole I been climbing in
Feels dark and wet and cold
Twenty five years on the Lousiana Bar
Make you feel five hundred years old

I don't want to do what I do
Do you, do you?
I don't want to do what I do

Didn't you hear the recession's on
Nobody wants to buy a new car
So I'll dick off for a couple of hours
Then drive down to the bar

I don't want to do what I do
Do you, do you?
I don't want to do what I do, do you?

I've been healing the sick and lame
That part feels okay
But I been dealing with the managed care
And I just can't get paid
I just can't get paid

I don't want to do what I do
Do you, do you?
I don't want to do what I do


(Owen Temple & Adam Carroll)
QUIET LOOK

She was wearing a black dress as she spoke across the years
He nearly dropped his drink to hear her voice ringing in his ears
Love in the ruins, late for the show
She said, love will always live, if we don't let it grow

I will pass you on the street and we will say trivial things
But I will never cease to search your eyes for that quiet look
And I will always be one who sighed for her quiet look

When you left our hometown, where did you go
He heard her answer and said sorry I didn't know
We don't have secrets but we'd have some if we'd meet
She said, love stays romantic if it stays incomplete

I will pass you on the street and we will say trivial things
But I will never cease to search your eyes for that quiet look
And I will always be one who sighed for her quiet look

She said, back then I always felt so strange
It's like a revelation to see that nothing has changed
What am I seeking - a lost piece of myself
I left with you like a key upon a shelf

I will pass you on the street and we will say trivial things
But I will never cease to search your eyes for that quiet look
And I will always be one who sighed for her quiet look
GOLDEN AGE

A building filled with a hundred rooms, looms overhead
Behind the glass and curtains, a million lovers beds
They bulldozed that old beer joint where we drank for free
They put a hotel on the skyline where O. Henry's used to be

Four thousand days ago in a flood of summer rays
These are streets I know back from the golden age

It was dark as night at the crack of noon, Lucky Strikes and gin
The sun goes down, the clock goes round, oh to be twenty one again
Dominoes, the stories go, onto another round
Another day, bills to pay, til the Hilton tore it down

Four thousand days ago in a flood of summer rays
These are streets I know back from the golden age

Sunglasses mask a passing glance as the light begins to fade
Wind blows trash across the street like a mardi gras parade
Staggering like a harlequin I drank at every bar
Finally found my way to sleep in the backseat of my car

Four thousand days ago in a flood of summer rays
These are streets I know back from the golden age


(Owen Temple, Gordy Quist)
WINNIPEG WALTZ

Two frozen rivers with ice like boulders
Cracking past Portage and Main
Dark downtown buildings, one glowing tavern
Breaking loose from winter's chains

Winter wind whistling the outside air
Inside it's like we found summer somewhere
My car is all rusted from road crew salt
And doing the Winnipeg waltz

Railroads and water, Assiniboine and Red,
The reasons why we're here
The center of the continent, the middle of it all
Hanging out and drinking beer

It's too cold to snow now but we don't care
Inside it's like we found summer somewhere
My car is all rusted from road crew salt
From doing the Winnipeg waltz

I love you more in the frozen winter
I think about you beneath your clothes
lets have one more drink in this crowded tavern
I'll kiss your chilly lips and your frozen nose

Winter wind whistlin' the outside air
Inside it's like we found summer somewhere
You won't turn to a pumpkin or a pillar of salt
From doing the Winnipeg waltz
MOUNTAIN HOME
2011
MOUNTAIN HOME

He's going back to Mountain Home
Cedar trees and stone
Said he's been gone too long
He's going back to Mountain Home

Live oak and limestone and rivers when it rains
Big sky and cedar trees and cold clear springs
Every shade of blue, every shade of green
He's had gray prison walls, he's due a change of scene

He's going back to Mountain Home
Cedar trees and stone 
Said he's been gone too long
He's going back to Mountain Home

That trouble at the ranch dragged down the family name
But he says he got more than his share of the blame
He's been locked up in Huntsville for twenty years or so
The middle of nowhere is where he wants to go

He's going back to Mountain Home
Cedar trees and stone
Said he's been gone too long
He's going back to Mountain Home

Flashing yellow light intersection in town
Tells travelers to take warning, but most folks don't slow down
With the post office closed, the wind's the only sound   
He's headed home on a one way Greyhound

He's going back to Mountain Home
Cedar trees and stone 
Said he's been gone too long
He's going back to Mountain Home

To that hilltop all alone
He's going back to Mountain Home
DESDEMONA

I was living south of Beaumont in a muddy cheap hotel
I was drilling all my money into a salt dome on the hill
You came along and everything changed
Gusher came in blowing like a black hurricane

Where'd you go Desdemona
Where did you go
Can't make it here without you
Where did you go

Up in Eastland County, gave a town your name
Near the barrooms of Ranger, the boomtowns of the plains
Many a man tried to make you stay
But now they're in the ground and you're gone away

Where'd you go Desdemona
where did you go
It's no life here without you
Where did you go

Oil reservoirs collapsed, gas pressure's gone
Roughnecks and gamblers moved out and moved along
The river is dead, the timber's trucked out on the roads
Remember the days when that oil money flowed

Where'd you go Desdemona
Where did you go
Can't make it here without you

Where'd you go Desdemona
Where did you go
You gave a town your name and nothing else to show
There's no life here without you
Desdemona, where did you go
MEDICINE MAN

All over the land he's spoken of
Wise as a snake, gentle as a dove
When that wolf wears sheep clothes
He shakes dust off his feet before he goes

He's a medicine man
He's a medicine man

He walks the lands, you never seen before
He's on a mission, conquistador
He'll be your slave, he'll be your king
He'll be what you want, be your everything

He's a medicine man
He's a medicine man

Bells and beads, he'll give you some
There's a whole lot more where that comes from
He'll make a sign and touch your head
Make you shake and dance gonna raise the dead

He's a medicine man
He's a medicine man

He'll walk on waves, he'll fix your health
Get what you need to save himself
Might lose your house, might lose your home
But he'll give you back more than you have known 
He will rise your tide, he will set your sun
Be your dealer, your healer, your only one

He's a medicine man
He's a medicine man


(Owen Temple, Adam Carroll, Gordy Quist)
SMALL TOWN

This small town the kind of place, to wipe a smile off your face
They don't mess around in a small town
You may know how things go up in San Antonio
But they can shut you down in a small town

Visiting your friend of a friend, no telling how your day will end
Stuff you don't know goes down in a small town
That girl you were talking to, her boyfriend's on to you
Probably following you around in a small town

Who got in too deep
Who's awake and who's asleep
Who just can't settle down
In a small town

Get out or get along, come back or just stay gone
Don't be looking down on a small town
You might a had a busy year, well not around here
There's hard times going round in a small town
So don't be looking down on a small town
DANGER AND GOOD TIMES

Slanted eyebrows looking over his glasses
Hand on a hip flicking cigarette ashes
Listening to music with self-employed stresses
Selling all them heaters at midnight in Texas

That ain't no microphone pass me a hit
I'd just as soon not mess with it
Too fat to fly to stoned to stack BBs
Millions of records, thousands of CDs

Danger and good times
Ain't too hard to find
So please show me a sign
Through danger and good times

I can do you one better than that, see how this band is so well known 
But that first band he was in, was bad to the bone
I ain't never heard about no farmer going down to the Bahamas
It's a little thing- I like to call Karma

Danger and good times
All the way down the line
It's a mighty thin line
Between danger and good times

Watch yourself out there- they'll knock you down
Golden years? I'm gonna have fun right now
More messed up Than a turned over tackle box 
Check the phonebook- there's only one Acox

Danger and good times
Ain't too hard to find
Please show me a sign
Danger and good times

There's danger and good times
All the way down the line
Please show me a sign
There's danger and good times


(Owen Temple, Adam Carroll, Scott Nolan)
FALL IN LOVE EVERY NIGHT

Boots and rhinestones
Canadian tuxedoes
Honky tonk zeros
Neon lights

Rocky Mountain beer signs
Parking lot Thunderbird wine
Ten 'til showtime
Dim the lights
Fall in love every night

Metal building stage sound
North Texas showdown
Feeling high and lowdown
Staying up all night

That kid's gonna be a star 
But he can't find his car
He used his guitar 
In a back room fight
He falls in love every night

Bouncing hot checks 
Surviving car wrecks
Where you gonna sleep next
Hold on tight
Fall in love every night

Drinks his own snake oil
Mixed with Crown Royal
Crank in tin foil
Blacks and whites

Played cards with Freddie King
Lost everything
That he got to play and sing
But that's all right
He falls in love every night

The clothes you slept in
You play the gig in
Don't bother to tuck it in man
It looks all right
You fall in love every night
You fall in love every night
Fall in love every night
JACKSBORO HIGHWAY

Tinsy Eggleston rode a car bomb to Kingdom Come
Elmer Holliday laid in a shallow grave, he had to go away
Locals speaking of the Ringside Pub and the Dueces Club
Keep voices low, Little Chicago is Fort Worth you know

A five mile strip, the further you went the badder it'd get
7 nightclubs, 10 motor inns to get lost in
Black book with cops' names and dollar signs
Every now and then one of them gets out of line
The Chief of Police and the DA are down Jacksboro Highway

Saw Sally Rand with an ostrich fan at a fireworks stand
And the greasy spoon's upstairs room was packed at noon
High stakes poker games and slot machines
Downstairs there's no one there, just empty chairs
Parking lot full to the break of day down Jacksboro highway

Chrome wheels of Oldsmobiles' trunks are filled 
With contraband so please don't tell Uncle Sam
At the Tower Motel, they won't tell what they sell
Word gets around, when a car explodes it shakes the ground
It's funny how time slips away down Jacksboro Highway


(Owen Temple, Adam Carroll)
OLD SAM

Timber Ridge, Virginia is a mighty fine place
From that soil sprung a leader of the human race
He had eyes full of thunderstorms and hair like gold
He was seven foot tall when he was six years old
Old Sam, Big Sam

Down in Alabama in 1812 
He and Andy Jackson raised all kind of hell
Got shot by an arrow but he had no fear
Hero was the job that he chose for his career
Old Sam, Big Sam

Sam got tired of being the governor of Tennessee
So the Raven flew south to be a drunk Cherokee
He slapped a nasty Congressman right in the face
He said y'all go to hell, I'm gonna find a better place for 
Old Sam, Big Sam

He rambled on down to western Arkansas
Kicked around Oklahoma where he took up with a squaw
In those days Texas was damn near Mexico
Old Sam decided next that was where he's gonna go
Old Sam, Big Sam

That devil Santa Anna was a molester and a thief
Getting him throwed out a Texas was a mighty big relief 
After swatting Santa Anna like you would a pesky fly
He drank a river full of whiskey and ate a piece of pie
Old Sam, Big Sam

Sam told folks not to start a Civil War
But they told Sam just to go and find the door
He sired eight more kids on the Gulf Coast plain
They don't bear the scars but they all bear the name of 
Old Sam, Big Sam

Sam Houston stood tall, he was true and tough
That statue's pretty big, but it ain't big enough for 
Old Sam, for Big Sam
Old Sam, Big Sam

ONE DAY CLOSER TO RAIN

Well's drying up and the creek is gone
Dust is flying, cows are skin and bone
Drought like this could drive you from your home
But we're one day closer to rain

Weatherman stands there waving his arms
But there's no more bales of hay down in the barn
Corn crop's dead on my old man's farm
He said we're one day closer to rain

My brother works at a bank in San Antonio
Said the Feds locked the doors two weeks ago
The numbers didn't add up and their business was slow
One day closer to rain

Hurricane last summer from the Gulf of Mexico
Ran aground and dumped an ocean on San Angelo
It was flooding in the desert just a year ago 
So we're one day closer to rain

Won't be water, be fire next time
But a forty day flood would suit me just fine
Be on the deck of an ark with a fishing line
If we're one day closer to rain

Well's drying up and the creek is gone
Dust is flying, cows are skin and bone
Drought like this could drive you from your home
But we're one day closer to rain
One day closer to rain

STORIES THEY TELL
2013
LOOKING FOR SIGNS

A thunderstorm shook my bed
And I thought of all the things you said
Earthquake shook the ground
Like it never did with you around
The Moon's covered up by clouds 
Ashamed to show his face
Tides move like they rarely do
Things all out of place

I'm looking for signs
Seeking the stars
Watching the planets move
Wondering where you are
Looking for signs
for all to see
Heaven and earth
want you with me

Heads you lose, tails I win
Magic eight ball said "try again"
Pulling petals off a rose
The fortune teller said "who knows"
I threw hundred cash down a wishing well
Listening for a tolling bell
Raising hands, shaking bones 
Someone like you shouldn't be alone

I'm looking for signs
Seeking the stars
Watching the planets move
Wondering where you are
Looking for signs
for all to see
Heaven and earth
want you with me

Played 5 card draw with a tarot deck 
I beat Death at every deal
Lovers and the Fool reversed
All to change the way you feel 
The lion laid down with the sheep
Hawk cooing like a dove
Unnatural things beyond belief
Telling you to fall in love

I'm looking for signs
Seeking the stars
Watching the planets move
Wondering where you are
Looking for signs
for all to see
Heaven and earth
want you with me
MAKE SOMETHING

Tighten up that string, stomp your foot on the floor
Find some words to sing, open up your door
Grow the tree, carve the wood, polish till it shines, 
Find the better way, something that saves time
Go on light the way that noone's ever seen
Bridge the gap, draw the map of the places in between

Make something, make your own
There's a statue waiting inside a block of stone
Twist the knob on that amp 'til you find the right tone
Make something, make your own

That picture in your head, put it on the wall
Paint it on a cave, hang it in the hall
Change the oil, change the tire, get it rolling true
Do your best on the test, that's all that we can do
If it's beautiful but useless, don't be ashamed
Show it to your people, don't forget to sign your name

Make something, make your own
There's a statue waiting inside a block of stone
Take a hammer and a nail, build someone a home
Make something, make your own
Make something, shake something with both hands
Leave your mark, throw a spark so the world will understand

That restlessness to see what's over the next hill
Keeps you up at night, probably always will
So keep the fire burning, on into the dark
But if it keeps on raining, go on and build an ark
Fall in love, raise a child, teach her right from wrong
Build her up, raise her tough, so she can write a song

Make something, make your own
There's a garden rising up from seeds that were sown
Tell the story that the world has never known
Makes something, make your own

Make something, shake something, up and go
Believe me when I say, the clock ain't moving slow
Make something, while you can
If you want to live forever, better make something man
While you can, make something man
BIG MAN

Dashing, young, and full of charm 
Ambitious as the wind
Fear and greed helped him 
Climb over all his friends
He worked angles like a sheepdog
Dividing up the herd
They voted him in office once
The law became his word 
Became a big man
 
Big man, put on your power suit
Big man, find the shortest route
Big man, you got it down
Big man pictures all around
Big man

Grabbed cash where he could find it
Took over all the banks
Protecting people from themselves
With rockets, guns, and tanks
When it's time to shake things up
When illusion's wearing thin
Blood's like water on dry land
Time to make it rain again
For the big man

Big man, play your strongest suit
Big man, twenty one gun salute
Big man loves his job so much
Iron fist and a velvet touch
Of the big man
Big man

Middle aged and paranoid
Man he'd better be 
He wrote the book on ruthlessness
Called it "destiny"
Rumors fly like sparrows
Whispers like a shout
The swimming pool is cracked
Now the water's draining out
For the big man

Big man, try to stand your ground
Big man says he won't come down
Big man loves his job so much
Iron fist and a velvet touch
Big man

Big man walking out alone
Big man never going home
Big man boots on the other foot
Gonna give back all you took
Big man
Oh the big man
CITIES MADE OF GOLD

I was headed west through El Paso
I had broke down by the side of the road
Guitar, a smoking car, and an empty bottle
The sun was sinking through the blowing dust
A truck passed by, then backed up
She said, "tough luck, do you want a ride?"

Searching for El Dorado
The days were hot, the desert nights were cold
A modern day Coronado
Looking for cities made of gold

She held the gun while I watched the door
The bank teller laid on the floor
We cleaned out the cash from seven highway towns
Midnight driving with the devil's moon
We drank champagne in our hotel room
Making stacks of money, then we'd knock em down

Searching for El Dorado
The days were hot, the desert nights were cold
Modern day Coronado
Looking for cities made of gold

I woke up in the morning, she was gone
I heard the breaking news, she left the TV on
No description of her, but I saw my face on the screen
She took the money and she's on the run
She left the truck and the stolen gun
I remembered her words: "tough luck, do you want a ride"

Searching for El Dorado
The days were hot and the desert nights were cold
A modern day Coronado
Looking for cities made of gold
She's still looking for cities made of gold

CRACKING THE CODE

A window to the world in hand
Tablets, books, tools of man
Take a picture quick, remember it
Gates and Jobs and halls of fame
Has rock n roll gone dead again
Like Lazarus, faking it

They're cracking the code again
Making all kinds of friends
Together we're all alone
When the master serves a machine too long

Read the writing on the wall
Don't say too much, reveal it all
Toss your dream in the stream
I don't need to touch your skin
I saw your face in a book we're in
So popular, love so pure

They're cracking the code again
Making all kinds of friends
Together we're all alone
When the master serves a machine too long

Keep your profile up to date
How you feel and where you ate
Your foolish grin, baby where you been
Am I who you think I am
Zeroes, ones, the tools of man
Open source, use the force

Cracking the code again
Making all kinds of friends
Together we're all alone
When the master serves a machine too long


(Owen Temple, Gordy Quist)
MAN FOR ALL SEASONS

As the wheel turns around it makes no sound
In the struggle between oak and holly
The sun will shine all in good time
But the moon is forever falling

Midsummer morn when our love was born
By winter it seemed to be fading
But snow melts away and the robin seems to say
All along tree buds were waiting

Spring summer fall, I loved you for all
Time and for all the right reasons
In wintertime still I always will
Be your man for all seasons

Birth, life, decline in four four time
Couples on the dance floor are reeling
Moving like stars or drinking at the bar
She says once more with feeling

Spring summer fall, I loved you for all
Time and for all the right reasons
In wintertime still I always will
Be your man for all seasons

The lights on trees, the shadows on the leaves
I can't hear what you were saying
All the mothers were brides with children in their eyes
All while the guitars were playing

Spring summer fall, I loved you for all
Time and for all the right reasons
In wintertime still I always will
Be your man for all seasons

As the wheel turns around it makes no sound
In the struggle between oak and holly
The sun will shine all in good time
But the moon is forever falling
BE THERE SOON

If I were to walk down this road, would I find you?
Waiting there for me to stop the noise and break on through
I could always call, but that ain't the same
I'll be there soon, I'll be there soon

Out here in the hills, I can see the plains where you reside
Safe from all the thrills, living like a saint with nothing to hide
I could always run, I could always fly
I'll be there soon, I'll be there soon

Tell all of your friends that you're running late
I'll be there soon, I'll be there soon

Out here on the road, driving fast, not worried about my life
Headed straight to you, only thing in my way are trains and lights
I'd give anything to get to you tonight
I'll be there soon, I'll be there soon


(Owen Temple, Paul Cauthen, David Beck)
HOMEGROWN

The old farmer had a look in his eye 
Like he knew something I didn't know
I was rushing around trying to get out of town
To somewhere I needed to go
He said, "You look like you're running hard, I've been there before"
I said, "I ain't getting any younger and I barely got my foot in the door"
He said, "Ain't how fast you run, you got to know which way to go
To make something last, sometimes you've got to take it slow"

He said, 
Take time, age like wine
Creep along like a grapevine, on and on
If you want fruit
You need strong roots
There's no substitute
Make your own
Homegrown

He said, "If you're hardheaded like I used to be, 
you're gonna do it your own way 
It's up to you, but all you can do is grow a little every day"
I'd been chasing my tail around, shooting out of range
Acting like a clown, something's gotta change

I'm gonna 
Take time, age like wine
Creep along like a grapevine, on and on
If you want fruit
You need strong roots
There's no substitute
Make your own 
Homegrown

JOHNSON GRASS

Pour me another my dreams do fly
Above the Johnson grass so high
Reflections of Daddy's dreams
Floating on a yellow submarine
He wore that open road so well
The Stetson hat he helped sell
Shared three letters L B J
So Lady Bird won't fly away

Now he wears his hair a little long
He's got seven telephones
Not used to being left alone
He's got seven telephones
They don't ring like they used to

Hill Country boy with dirt on his shoes
Walking around with borrowed blues
Holding men and dogs up by their ears
Master of ten thousand fears
He's drinking Fresca mixed with scotch
He damn sure loves these Stonewall rocks
He's going to the Folk Fest to hear a band
He told the Secret Service to clap their hands

Now he wears his hair a little long
He's got seven telephones
South Asia mess, who could have known?
He's got seven telephones
They don't ring like they used to

His eyes could burn like a lighted fuse
Hold on so tight so you don't lose
Your brass halo and duct tape wings
Held you up awhile then made a mess of things
Yeah it's time for you, it's time you had fun
The Mr President days are done
He says, "move over driver I'll take the wheel
Before I forget how driving feels"

Now he wears his hair a little long
He's got seven telephones
Did he do more right than he got wrong?
He's got seven telephones
They don't ring like they used to

Pour me another my dreams do fly
Above the Johnson grass so high

STORIES THEY TELL

Cracks on the floor, lines in your face
Marking the time in this beat up place
Hours and days, scratches and scars
Old towns, broken down cars
What is left behind is just an empty shell 
What lives on are the stories they tell
 
Cradled in ash, impressions in stone
Locked up in ice, blankets of snow
Amber and bones, writing on the walls
Build it up, still everything falls
What is left behind is just an empty shell 
What lives on are the stories they tell

Amber and bones, writing on the walls
Build it up, everything falls
What is left behind is just the crack in the bell
What lives on are the stories they tell
What lives on are the stories they tell

SIX NATIONS CALEDONIA

Grand River wide, slow, and deep
Six Nations wake from a long night's sleep
On the tracks, a blockade
Gonna stop the flow of the white man's trade
Caledonia

How come they don't have Iroqouis names
How come the judge won't hear their claims
Miles of land, each side of the river
Burned the note the cops delivered
Caledonia

Founding fathers, rising sons
Mothers, daughters all in one
They rolled a six, can't roll no seven
But all the kids gonna roll to heaven
Caledonia

Shut down the power, God save the queen
Truck on fire down at the scene
Warehouses of the reservations 
Cigarettes smoking on six nations
Caledonia

Founding fathers, rising sons
Mothers, daughters all in one
They rolled a six can't roll no seven
But all the kids gonna roll to heaven
Caledonia

Grand River wide, slow, and deep
Six Nations wake from a long night's sleep


(Owen Temple, Gordy Quist)
The Dirty South

I drank White Lightning when I was still in a crib
I had a moon pie smeared all over my bib
I punched my first grade teacher right straight in the mouth
Cause that's how we do it in the Dirty South

Got a Dale Jr. tattoo here on my back
And my ears are still ringing from the NASCAR track
I punched Jeff Gordon right straight in the mouth
Cause that's how we do it in the Dirty South

SOLO

My baby takes her top off when we go to the lake
She's soft and sexy but she's mean as a snake
If I catch you looking at her punch you straight in the mouth
That's how we do it in the Dirty South

The C.M.T. award show was a hell of a time
Tanya Tucker winked at me when was standing in line
My wife punched her right straight in the mouth
Cause that's how we do it in the Dirty South
Yeah that's how we do it in the Dirty South


That's When the Eagle Screams

Folks are talking and a-talking a how the U.S. ain't the best
But the eagle is getting tired of y'all shitting in his nest
You thought he was only sleeping, you plucked feathers out one by one
But he just had one eye closed, so amigo ya better run

Cause we're flying down to Mexico, we're gonna rain on your parade
Thirty pounds of angry eagle and he damn sure ain't afraid
Look out if you gonna take potshots at these American dreams
Cause just when you ain't watching, that's when the eagle screams

It's a sticky situation for ol' Jacque and Pierre
Maple syrup can't stop eagles when they're flying through the air
You can keep your old bacon, you can have your natural gas
Look out you old maple leaf, you can kiss this eagle's ass

Cause we're flying up to Canadia, we're gonna rain on your parade
Thirty pounds of angry eagle, he damn sure ain't afraid
Look out if you gonna take potshots at these American dreams
Cause just when you ain't watching, that's when the eagle screams - Shaw!

SOLO

And as for you old Aussies, look out for number one
You can keep your old koala bear and Olivia Newton-John
You can get physical all you want, but we're gonna make it stick
With some good ol' apple pie and a big ol' eagle dick

Cause we're flying up to Stralia, we're gonna rain on your parade
Thirty pounds of angry eagle, he damn sure ain't afraid
Look out if you gonna take potshots at these American dreams
Cause just when you ain't watching, son, that's when the eagle screams 
Just when you ain't looking, that's when the eagle screams




Stand Back Boys I'm Fixing to Care 

The desert rose cantina in Phoenix AZ
Can be a lonely ol' place for a singer like me
Pretty peroxide blonde sitting close to the stage
Thirty-six, twenty-four and a third of my age
She's looking at this cowboy with a sexy stare
Stand back boys I'm fixing to care
Stand back boys I'm fixing to care

She sucks on a longneck and licks her lips
Eats a handful of cherries and shakes her hips
She turns around and shows me her zebra thong
She yells out that the Dirty South is her favorite song
I want some honey like a grizzly bear
Stand back boys I'm fixing to care
Stand back boys I'm fixing to care

She smokes a Camel 100 and tosses her hair

She looks about as juicy as a Bartlett pear

I want to lay on her like a La-Z-Boy Chair

Stand back boys I'm fixing to care
Stand back boys I'm fixing to care




A Hero Never Learns 

I took my mom to the Luby's after Friday night's football game
The man at the checkout line said "there goes old what's-her-name"
She said "you ought not talk that way to the people that raised you up"
So I stared him down and I clenched my fist, I said "mama, get in the truck"

Cause a hero never learns
Never tells nobody no
Never says I told you so
It's a fire that always burns
A hero never learns
A hero never learns

I drove my dog in my pickup truck out to the edge of town
To a place he'd never been before, then I turned that truck around
Ol' Hank was a good old dog but I had to set him free
I tried not to look in my rear view mirror as he was chasing after me

Cause a hero never learns
Never tells nobody no
Never says I told you so
It's a fire that always burns
A hero never learns
A hero never learns

Whole Lot Further to Fall 

From the top of the Empire State Building to the bottom of a Mexican whore
I've seen the high and low places most men ain't been before
Now to see me crawling, you think it's a new low
But wait and see how much distance I have got to go

I've got a whole lot further to fall
I'm crashing through your rock bottom and all
Look out below you devil, ol' Gary's coming to call
I got a whole lot further to fall

From the top of the Pyrenees mountains to the bottom of a Dutch canal
You might think I've done all the falling that the good Lord would allow
If you see a hole in your basement floor that's just Gary passing through
Sinking like a stone is what I was born to do

I've got a whole lot further to fall
I'm crashing through your rock bottom and all
Ah come on now, look out devil, ol' Gary's coming to call
I got a whole lot further to fall

Yeah, I got a whole lot further
I got a whole lot further to fall
I got a whole lot further
I got a whole lot further to fall


Holding On So Tight 

Hey Gary, you gonna run down to Carl's Corner and pick you out one of them lot lizards?
Negatory on the lot lizard, good buddy. I've had the old lady in mind for the last five hundred miles and I'm still a long way from home. 
Think this freight is gonna have to wait, ol' Gary's gonna crawl in the back and punch the clown.

I pulled into the truck stop, turned off the radio
I shut her down in the parking lot by the smoky neon glow
All the way down a big ol' shelf of magazines wrapped in plastic
But I did not even bat an eye, I just walked on past it

	I'm holding on so tight to thoughts of you at home
	These late nights on the road make a man feel alone
	Sometimes I get so lonely, right down to the bone
	Holding on so tight to thoughts of you at home

Well, it takes two to tango, but I'm dancing by myself
Like that pretty glass unicorn on the truckstop giftshop shelf
My fantasy seems so close, but I'm feeling so low
'Til I can touch you again, I just can't let go

	I'm holding on so tight to thoughts of you at home
	These late nights on the road make a man feel alone
	Sometimes I get so lonely, right down to the bone
	Holding on so tight to thoughts of you at home

SOLO

	I'm holding on so tight to thoughts of you at home
	These late nights on the road make a man feel alone
	Sometimes I get so lonely, right down to the bone
	Holding on so tight to thoughts of you at home



Grandpa's Promise 

He grew up in the Tennessee mountains without a penny to his name
He taught me how to be a man and how not be ashamed
Though he had only a rock for a pillow and granite pebbles were his only friends
He had something he had to tell me before his life would end
Though we were common people, he had uncommon pride 
And this is what he told me the day that he died
Heeyahhh!
That's what ol' grandpa said
Just before he left this world
And then he was dead

He was mean as a viper, sneaky as an old tomcat
He died with a hard on, but we won't talk about that
He never read a book, he never wrote a word
The moment 'fore he died 'Hyahh!' is what I heard


It's High Time This Old Cowboy Quit Getting So Goldanged High 

Heineken mornings and hashish afternoons
Wishing for long trips but they're ending too soon
Woke up in a bathtub fully dressed soaking wet
Chasing the whiskey it's mixed with regret

	It's high time this old cowboy quit getting so goldang high
	Can't soar like an eagle if you're too fucked up to fly
	Laughing just like a hyna, as the tears roll down my eye
	It's high time this old cowboy quit getting so goldang high
	It's high time this old cowboy quit getting so goldang high

All the folks I let down and everything I snorted
I didn't give an Amsterdam until I got deported
On that long flight back to JFK, I drank so much champagne
They had to tie me to my chair when I tried to fly the plane

	It's high time this old cowboy quit getting so goldang high
	Can't soar like an eagle if you're too fucked up to fly
	Laughing just like a hyna, as the tears roll down my eye
	It's high time this old cowboy quit getting so goldang high
	It's high time this old cowboy quit getting so goldang high

Let Me Kiss You Where It Hurts 

You say you've had it up to here
With all the lying and the tears
Your heart's been broke so many ways
That's why you're sitting here today
Watching bubbles in your beer

Well, darling I've been feeling blue
So can I sit down next to you
Throw some light upon the shade
In this honky-tonk parade
Let me look into your eye

Let me kiss you where it hurts
I put my finger on it first
Dancing while my flashlight shines
That you see from time to time
Let me kiss you where it hurts

I've got my nine volts in the car
In case we wander off too far
You don't even have to ask
I'll put on my rubber mask 
Let me kiss you where it hurts

I've got a camera in the van
That's just the kind of man I am
We'll throw some loving on YouTube
Just to see what we can do
Let me kiss you where it hurts

I've got a bobcat-colored jacket
I've got a pair of golden keys
Nobody's ever asked me why
I'm just an ordinary guy
Let me kiss you where it hurts

Let me kiss you where it hurts
I'll put my finger on it first
Dancing while my flashlight shines
That you see from time to time
Let me kiss you where it hurts
Come on, let me kiss you where it hurts



Dust Off the Dulcimer (One More Time) 

Butterscotch in a candy bowl
Sticky peppermint and a Tootsie Roll
Doily protects the table there
Plastic covers on all his chairs

Grandpa dust off the dulcimer one more time, one more time
Grandpa dust off the dulcimer one more time
You can't keep it to yourself, can't keep it on that shelf 
Got to dust off the dulcimer one more time

Wilford Brimley on a TV there
He sold grandpa a scooter chair
Refrigerator full of ol' Schlitz beer
Grandpa used to be an auctioneer

Grandpa dust off the dulcimer one more time, one more time
Grandpa dust off the dulcimer one more time
You can't keep it on a shelf, you can't keep it to yourself
Got to dust off the dulcimer one more time

Guess I didn't inherit that old man's hands
I can't play an instrument worth a damn
Now the house is dark at eight PM
He's taking off his slippers getting all tucked in

Grandpa dust off the dulcimer one more time, one more time
Grandpa dust off the dulcimer one more time
You can't keep it on a shelf, you can't keep it to yourself
Got to dust off the dulcimer one more time

SOLO

Driving in I passed the fishing hole
Grandpa's gone but I saw his pole
His jumpsuit's on a hanger there
Thought I heard a dulcimer ringing in the air

Grandpa dust off the dulcimer one more time, one more time
Grandpa dust off the dulcimer one more time
You can't keep it on a shelf, you can't keep it to yourself
Got to dust off the dulcimer one more time

You can't keep it on a shelf, don't keep it to yourself
Grandpa dust off the dulcimer one more time


That's What I'm Gonna Do

This old world can be confusing
All the colors shapes and sounds
Rules and regulations
Plants and animals abound

Sometimes it's hard to know
Just where a country boy belongs
What a country boy should feel
When he hears a country song

	I'm gonna kiss my kids and go to work
	Drive around in a truck like a big old jerk
	Punch the clock and then I'll drink a brew
	That's what I'm gonna do

Must be nice to go to Starbucks
Drink a Frappaccino tea
Smell my Folgers in the morning light
Folgers is good enough for me

	I'm gonna kiss my kids and go to work
	Drive around in a truck like a big old jerk
	Punch the clock and then I'll drink a brew-
	I come crawling in at 3 AM
	Breathin' on you when you're all tucked in
	Make sweet love for a minute or two
	That's what I'm gonna do

	Gonna kiss my kids and go to work
	Drive around in a truck like a big old jerk
	Punch the clown and then I'll drink a brew
	That's what I'm gonna do
	That's what I'm gonna do
	That's what I'm gonna do
	That's what I'm gonna do

Coach's Song

Coach was standing alone
With a wet megaphone
In the pouring rain
They thought he was insane
He's got his plumsmugglers on
Singing a coach's song
Playbook in his hand
Beneath the stadium stands

	It's not a threat, it's a fact
	We gotta win district back
	We gotta clean up our act
	It's not a threat, it's a fact

Just look up on that wall
The boys who won district before
Those are the faces of winners
That you see by the door
Rainwater streams off his brim
This town don't believe in him
Those boys had no fear
Like a truck in winning gear

	It's not a threat, it's a fact
	We gotta win district back
	This time there's no looking back
	It's not a threat, it's a fact

They haven't won a game
But he's got district dreams
He tackled himself 
For the good of the team
Over a glass of wine
At the house with his wife
To bring that trophy in
He'd gladly give his life

	It's not a threat, it's a fact
	We gotta win district back
	This time there's no looking back
	It's not a threat, it's a fact

Y'all Watch This

We were down at the quarry, having a hell of a time
There was a hundred foot ditch, trucks parked by the edge in a line
Jimmy jumped in his truck and he raised up a Shiner Bock
He hollered out the window, truck tires spinning out over the rocks

Y'all watch this, y'all watch me
Them words are burned in my memory 
Y'all watch this, y'all watch me
That truck caught fire like you rarely see
Y'all watch this

We were up on the spillway, though they said that the dam was closed
We were taking in the view when Eddie took off his clothes
He drank a chug of Mad Dog 20 then he raised up a rebel yell
Eddie sure could whoop and holler, but he couldn't swim too well

Y'all watch this, y'all watch me
He wasn't quite sure where the water'd be
Y'all watch this

We were south of Laredo, having a ball at that ol' Boys Town
Delbert couldn't speak good Spanish, that night he was throwing it down
He really only knew two words, vato and odelay
He yelled em as jumped onstage, pushed the donkey out of the way

Y'all watch this, y'all watch me
That donkey show wasn't meant to be
Sometimes life don't match plans
He's gonna need a doctorman
Y'all watch this
Pull Over I Want to Eat That


I really shouldn't, I'm stuffed
You think I've had enough
Eat 'til I shit pants
Come on give me another chance

	I gotta take care of these hungry dreams
	Til I'm satisfied
	Pull over I want to eat that
	I want to eat it with country pride

Cow, chicken, or pig
Put it on a sign real big
Til I'm full as a tick
Well, I think I'm gonna be sick

	I gotta take care of these hungry dreams
	Til I'm satisfied
	Pull over I want to eat that
	I want to eat it with country pride

SOLO

Oh no you didn't, honky please
Hands off that American cheese
Country boy, country ham
Chicken fried, hot damn!

	I gotta take care of these hungry dreams
	Til I'm satisfied
	Pull over I want to eat that
	I want to eat it with country pride
	Pull over I want to eat that
	I want to eat it with country pride
Summertime sunnyshine lake bum sunburnt assholes on a boat
Jet ski out on a ski bob like a wet billy goat
Out on Sunburn Lake, down on Shitface Dam
My cutoff jorts are wet and I can't remember who I am

With my deep sea necklace shells that shine
I feel like a native from an earlier time
With a hat cut off at the top of my head
I feel like a pirate and the pirate said
Caribbean jerk chicken on my plate
Out on Sunburn Lake

SOLO

Up on Jackass Creek, down on Shithead Dam
When I'm out on Sunburn Lake with a catfish in my hand
Sunblock on my nose, jet ski rides a wake
Baby takes her top off out on Sunburn Lake

With my deep sea necklace shells that shine
I feel like a native from an earlier time
With my hat cut off at the top of my head
I feel like a pirate and the pirate said
Caribbean jerk chicken on my plate
Out on Sunburn Lake
Up on Jackass Creek

I have got this guitar made of wood
Don't you think this guitar sounds so good
My roots are deep in this genre's music tree
Americana me

I wish my grandpa was still alive today
On our front porch, Americana's what he'd play
You know some things ain't the way they used to be
They can change, not Americana me

This guitar made of wood and wire and steel
Helps me get that Americana feel
This genre is the perfect choice for me
Americana me

I have got this guitar made of wood
Don't you think this guitar sounds so good
Grandpa, you'd be so proud to see

Stories From the Old Bible

When I was just a young pup, barely 3 foot high
My daddy'd drink some cool ones, and get a twinkle in his eye
He'd start to telling stories from a Bible no one ever heard
Some folks said he made it up- I believe every word

He said there's an Old Bible, not the new one they've got out
That his daddy told him stories from, and he never had a doubt
He'd crack another cold one, tell stories never heard before
He'd pretty much act it out, them old tales of the Lord

He said dinosaurs tried to kill Jesus, but he fought em with his lightsaber
T. Rex and Pterodactyle could not tear down the savior
Listen to the stories daddy taught me well
How Jesus fought the dinosaurs and sent them all to hell

Then his spaceship took flight, he said he'd be back again
He'd come back down to Georgia, and help Charlie Daniels  win
So I don't want to see your pictures of satanic giraffe
I don't believe in fossils, they only make me laugh 
Listen to the stories my daddy taught me well
How Jesus fought the dinosaurs and sent them all to hell

I'm getting high with Guy
Getting high with Guy
Guy and I 
My, my, my
Get so high

I wrote a song with Guy
Guy and I wrote a song
That song is strong
Me and Guy

He said a hundred percent of the pie
Belongs to Guy
If this song should fly
Getting high with Guy
High, high, high


Yessir

As my favorite singer sang I yelled out a loud "yessir!"
And he looked kind of startled, I guess I musta caused quite a stir
I took a picture of myself watching him with a camera phone I bring
So I won't forget the day I saw that ol' boy see me watch him sing

I pointed to my eyes with two fingers, then straight at his, his eyes how they shined
He had his elevens showing - we were touching each other's mind
I know we had a moment made us both feel a little less alone
Seeing him, seeing me, yell at him, the greatest day I've ever known

Willie, Waylon, Merle, and George played Branson - each sang a tender song
Each time I hollered out "yessir," they glared at me like I'd done something wrong
But I saw Nelson watching Jennings watching Haggard as he was watching Jones
Seeing them, seeing me, yell at them, the greatest day I've ever known




Making my way on the circuit, being a part of the scene
I'm not playing to empty rooms, it's bartenders and me

Who cares? Me cares, me cares about me and my song

The crowd has left this venue, they can't find my flow
I was working this bar for free, but they had to let me go

Who cares? Me cares, me cares about me and my song
Who cares? Me cares, me cares about me and my song

With all this premium talent, I can carry this show alone
But they have revoked my license, so I'm gonna need a ride home

Who cares? Me cares, me cares about me and my song
Who cares? Me cares, me cares about me and my song

SOLO

Who cares? Me cares, me cares about me and my song
Who cares? Me cares, me cares about me and my song

Who cares? Me cares, me cares about me and my song

Who cares? Me cares, me cares about me and my song
(All the Oak Ridge Boys)
Who cares? Me cares, me cares about me and my song
Who cares? Me cares, me cares about me and my song
Who cares? We cares, we cares about we and our song



My body's here but my mind's at home
One more hour 'til I'm spending time alone
I'd like to thank you all for bringing money here
At this time, I wish that I could disappear

	I'm phoning it in again, here you go
	Why did I agree to do this show?
	I don't know, I guess I'll have to plead the fifth
	Come on guys, let's get this over with

My beard and shades are like a mobile home
My singing mouth has got to do this job alone
This apathetic band is the best that I could find
I'm on my way to Cracker Barrel in my mind

	I'm phoning it in again, here you go
	Why did I agree to do this show?
	I don't know, I guess I'll have to drink a fifth
	Come on guys, let's get this over with

Just a shell of me is left and the smell of doom
The magic me has already left the room 
I don't know, I guess I'll have to drink a fifth
Come on guys, let's get this over with
Come on guys, let's get this over with



I'm a Alcoholic

Wine is meant to be spilled
Time is meant to be killed 
I'm behind on all my bills
I've got a serious problem

My health has gone to pot
My nerve's completely shot
This bottle's all I've got
This is not a joke

	I'm a alcoholic
	Yeah, no really, alcoholic
	Full blown alcoholic 
	I'm a alcoholic, eve-ry-day

Wine, whiskey, and beer
Can't reduce my fear
Still I hold booze dear
It's a disease, people

They say go on and turn the page
As I throw up on a stage
They say, come on, act your age
But I'm really feeling old right now

	I'm a alcoholic
	Oh yeah, alcoholic
	Country alcoholic 
	I'm a alcoholic, eve-ry-day


Well now, the free booze in this job
Turns me to a drunken slob
I hold my head and sob
I'm really sad now

In the songs I sing
Problems caused by one thing
I only stop-a my drink-ing 
Oh Lord!  When I pass out

	I'm a alcoholic
	Oh baby, alcoholic
	Total alcoholic 
	I'm a alcoholic, eve-ry-day

	I'm a alcoholic
	I'm singing out for help
	I never thought I'd end up like this
	Yeah, the party's put me down 

	I'm a alcoholic
	Total alcoholic 
	Full blown, everyday
	I'm a alcoholic eve-ry-day

Nature Song

Hear the chipmunk sing
Crickets rub their wings
The cow is moaning low
The river's flowing slow
I was staring at a deer
Does that make me queer
I guess it was a buck
I want it in my truck     

       Nature turns me on
       So I wrote a nature song
       I could fall in love with anything right now  

Squirrels shake and dance
The robin lost his pants
Every time I mow the grass
Fireflies light their ass
That possum in a tree
You're much too young for me
That fuzzy headed bear
He's pretending not to stare

       Nature turns me on
       So I wrote a nature song
       I could fall in love with anything right now

See that ol' raccoon
I invite it to my room
Lizard on the run
We sure had us some fun
Your candy to my eyes
But your parts are not my size
Mammals all around
How I'd love to lay them down

       Nature turns me on
       So I wrote a nature song
       I could fall in love with anything right now

I know the ring neck duck
Is a ruffle-feathered slut
Sleeping in the trees
The turkey is a tease
We both know it's not right
How you stay out all night
Every time I'm in the yard
Nature's looking at me hard

       Nature turns me on
       So I wrote a nature song
       I could fall in love with anything right now


Seamus Was a Hero

Two hundred years before I's born
Uncles Seamus caught a unicorn
Too little meat and too much horn
Seamus was a hero

He fashioned him a rope of vine
Spoke every boast that crossed his mind
How many unicorns do you find
Seamus was a hero

He rode him all the way to town
To show the creature he had found
The beast did puff and prance around
Seamus was a hero

The luckiest man ever born
Danced too close to the magic horn
He was impaled upon a unicorn
Seamus was a hero
Seamus was a hero



I fell asleep at our wedding, I dozed off making love to you
You bore me to tears, you tell me that I'm boring too
Just everyday losers with nothing else better to do

	Two boring people, two boring losers - in love
	Two nobodies, no one to take notice of
	They fit together like a hand in a big boring glove
	They're just everyday people, two boring losers in love

It's amazing to see the boring look in your eyes
It's hard to believe our completely uninteresting lives
Fight, fuck, break up, then make up when somebody cries

	Two boring people, two boring losers - in love
	Everyday assholes - the only kind I'm singing of
	They fit together like a hand in a big boring glove
	They're just everyday people, two boring losers in love
	They're just everyday people, two boring losers in love
Thanks Me

B flat

I was tucking myself in
At the Holiday Inn
It should have been a good night
The band was sounding tight 
I wonder why nobody came
They musta not recognized my name 
Up on the marquis sign
They spelled it wrong again this time
Whenever I feel this way
There's only one thing to say

	Thanks me, thanks me for the songs
	Always sang em right, I never wrote em wrong
	Congratulations me, the place should have been packed
	I say thank you to me, pat myself on the back 
	Thanks me

I was eating birthday cake
Off a lonesome paper plate
No postal letter came
Nobody yelled my name
Another feather falls
Another stranger calls
Another year gone by
So many visions in my eye
Whenever I get this way
There's only one thing to say

	Thanks me, thanks me for the songs
	Always wrote em right, never sang em wrong
	Congratulations me, the place should have been packed
	I say thank you to me, pat myself on the back 

	Thanks me, thanks me for the songs
	Always sang em right, never wrote em wrong

	Thanks you pal

Midnight at the Grocery Store

It was midnight at the grocery store
I'd forgotten what I came there for
So I stopped and thumped the produce for awhile
Then all pink and round I saw her there
I did my best, tried not to stare
But I starting closing in to the Frito aisle

Eye shadow blue, red lipstick lips
Right near a wall of flavored chips
Hair rollers rolled my heart around
Her flip flops flipped, my head did spin
She caught my gaze, she smiled and then
I dropped my can of bean dip to the ground

	Her makeup made her look surprised
	Her eyebrows aimed into my eyes
	She had a way of looking right through you
	The girl in the pink muu muu

When I came to, she was gone
I was on the floor at the break of dawn
A sad love song on the grocery store PA
Intercom said "clean up aisle four"
I stumbled out the exit door
A big fuchsia sky hung over me that day

	Her makeup made her look surprised
	Her eyebrows aimed into my eyes
	She had a way of looking right through you
	The girl in the pink muu muu

So don't waste your chance, I lost my dream
Love comes wrapped in many things
It appears, then disappears too soon
Now every night I walk the aisles
In a bathrobe, slippers with a crazy smile
My love floated in like a rose balloon

	Her makeup made her look surprised
	Her eyebrows aimed into my eyes
	She had a way of looking right through you
	The girl in the pink muu muu
	The girl in the pink muu muu
	The girl in the pink muu muu
	Muu muu


Hello Diabetes

Hello Diabetes, I knew you'd come to town
I've been waiting for you, wondering when you'd come around 
My blood sugar's rising up like the great speckled bird
Such a terrible disease- such a funny word

So hello Diabetes they told me you'd be here
I left the light on for you through all the Ding Dong years
So bring me a shot of insulin, tequila, and some lime
Hello Diabetes, you strange new friend of mine

All things must find a place to live and I guess that you do too
So get in with all the Twinkies, Big Red, and Mountain Dew
So bring me a shot of insulin with that ice cold beer
Hello Diabetes, they told me you'd be here
Solo!

Now I'm pricking my finger, taking all them pills
Hello Diabetes, my new Achille's heel




Selfish lover, please don't leave
Why do you make me wear a frown?
Selfish lover please believe 
I never meant to punch the clown

Grab the ice pack off the shelf
Why must you always leave me blue
I've taken matters in my own hands
Tell me what else can I do 

Selfish lover, please don't leave
Why do you make me wear a frown?
Selfish lover, please believe 
I never meant to punch the clown

Showdown at the Country Club

I try to use good manners like mama taught me to
But there's one thing a man just cannot do
So when you asked how's my wife, you know damn well
In polite conversation, there's things we just can't tell

The ice sculpture melts as I sip my wine
You ask how she's doing, I say she's doing fine
I know that you make love to her and you do it all the time
How can I shake the hand of the one who shit in mine?

At the buffet table, I say, "no, please, after you"
Country club manners, cocktail rendezvous
We talk about the weather, we talk about the news
But I must excuse myself for another glass of booze 

The ice sculpture melts as I sip my wine
You ask how she's doing, I say she's doing fine
I know that you make love to her and you do it all the time
How can I shake the hand of the one who shit in mine?

We talk of sports and golf, til it's time I said adieu
That's my Lincoln Towncar, well I guess you'd like to ride that too
I must say farewell as the valet holds my keys
I let my stink eye linger before I turn to leave

I pull my car into traffic from the valet line
You asked me how she's doing, I said she's doing fine
I know that you make love to her and you do it all the time
How can I shake the hand of the one who shit in mine?

Whatever Man

I'm proud of having pride
I stood up to take a stand
They said just sit down 
You couldn't find your ass with both hands
I'm a horse of a different color
In a one horse town
I'm the south end of a dead horse
You're beating on the ground

	Pain don't hurt
	Tears don't cry
	Leaves don't fall
	Death don't die
	Sad's not blue
	Red's not green
	Something like that
	You know what I mean
	Loud as I can
	I say, "whatever, man"

You can lead a gift horse to water
But it's either sink or swim
You said from your high horse
I don't want to be your friend
Well, that's the icing on the camel's back
Staring you in the face
The luck stops here I've had enough
Of this rock and hard place

	But pain don't hurt
	Tears don't cry
	Leaves don't fall
	Death don't die
	Sad's not blue
	Red's not green
	Something like that
	You know what I mean
	Loud as I can
	I say, "whatever, man"

Take that to the bank and smoke it
Too much sense I does not make
Glue can't put back together
The kind of song I break
They said, wake up and smell the butter
You're mumbling again
You were counting your chickens
They crossed the road again

	But pain don't hurt
	Tears don't cry
	Leaves don't fall
	Death don't die
	Sad's not blue
	Red's not green
	Something like that
	You know what I mean
	Loud as I can
	I say, "whatever, man"
Oh the river flows down to the river
Just like a river should
Standing here by the banks of the river
I can't help but say, "river, you're looking good"

And the river flows down to the river
And the river knows where the river goes
I'll go with you where the river delivers
All the way to the end of the river

Now we've come to the bridge
The one over the river to the other side
You and I, we're crossing that river
All the way - you and I

Oh the river flows down to the river
Just like a river should
Standing here by the banks of the river
I can't help but say, "river, you're looking good"

And the river flows down to the river
The river knows where the river goes
I'll go with you where the river delivers
All the way to the end of the river
The end of the river
To the river
On the river
The river flows
The river flows
The river flows
The river flows

White Christmas

'Twas in Bethlehem nigh that old Jordan River
A miraculous white boy was born
Though the folks all around had skin that was brown
He was white on that first Christmas morn

It was a glorious white Christmas
White like the star of Bethleham
Glorious white christmas
To celebrate white as I can

Like the loaves and the fishes my grandma has a way
Of turning cream of mushroom soup to casserole
Sacharrine and margarine I will consume
We're hungry white sheep in the fold

Glorious white Christmas
White like the star of Bethleham
Glorious white christmas
To celebrate white as I can
Let's celebrate that great white man

The Tigress is roaring down the hall, son
The Unsung heroes dancing at the ball, son
The Violin plays on Desire too much, son
The War was waged but it never was won

Xylophones were ringing in your brain, son
While yellow whirling dirbishs spun, son
The zither plays while the monkeys run, son
A to Z, it's all been done son

Boogie Bear

No mustache man can understand or believe the beard I bring
No smooth shaved face can take the place, gypsy lady I dance and sing

I'm a big ol boogie bear
I've got a beard and bushy hair
I got a load of {love} fun to share
I've got the beard to get you there
Like a big ol boogie bear

At my facial hair the ladies stare they cannot look away
Let's find a pina colada, a pink umbrella and a private place to play

Like a moses man I'll take your hand and dance you cross the floor
In the light parade I'll give you shade and leave you wanting more


I was sitting at home alone in my trailer stuffing promo cds into bubble wrap mailers I was feeling low down so i thought I'd get high then I opened my window and heard a loud cry  "hyyya Donner, hyyya Blitzen, hyaa Tanya and Conway hyyya Reba, hyya Charlie, hyya rose colored Conlee" shouting from a sleigh made in the shape of an eagle I knew that this man would do something illegal into my Camaro he rammed that old sleigh like he dented all cars that were parked in his way  he staggered out of the sleigh, he smelled like a chimp with his mask and his flashlight, he was dressed like a pimp his wireless microphone crackled, his pants were too tight his butt crack was showing when he lit up a light he barged into my trailer he broke down the door he scattered my CDs all over the floor the stockings he filled with signed guitar picks and giant stuffed eagles with big eagle dicks  such a clatter i heard up there on my shelf where he'd  left me a tape and pics of himself then he  played a song-- called Dirty South when i reached for a cookie I was punched in the mouth  then 3 van zandt brothers rode up on their Harleys With crystal meth, whiskey, and beer made of barley Old Ronnie Van Zandt  shouted out bold "that Floater cassette is pure country gold"  They had Frankenstein masks strapped onto their face They pushed me aside, barged into my place we drank up the whiskey, drank up the beer they talked about hunting hyenas and deer They unloaded stockings, rolled it up in some papers smoked and then ate, all of my nilla wafers  Floater gave me a dooby, that smelled like a skunk Then he laid on the floor on my trailer drunk I must have passed out, I fell on my face Those legends, those assholes, tore up my place  I woke up in a bathtub fully dressed soaking wet With "a hero never learns" tattooed on my chest It was dawn and I looked on the wreckage around Twinkie wrappers and masks, beer cans on the ground  Then the Camaro fired up and an eagle did scream I thought to myself this is just a bad dream I ran to the front door, with a tear on my eye Floater peeled out, flipped me off a goodbye  "Ding a ling ding a ling!", i heard from his mouth as he flew away with a song of the south He yelled "remember you all in this season of sweaters What you think you do well the Floater does better!"  I just wirt the songs the best that I can sincerely your outlaw, Gary Floaterman
Sinner I was once like you
I didn't know what to do
I put all my care into earthly things
Then I saw the lightning in the sky
Nearly got a DWI
Then I turned it all over to Zeus

Turn it over, turn it over
Turn it all over to Zeus
Turn it over, turn it over
Turn it on over to Zeus

Always blowing my own horn
Using stimulants and porn
I was a sorry sight to see
I had a run of real bad luck
Shit I nearly flipped my truck
Then I turned it on over to Zeus

Turn it over, turn it over
Turn it on over to Zeus
Turn it over, turn it over
Turn it on over to Zeus

Friday nights I take it back
Sunday I turn it loose-

That's right I turn it back over to Zeus

Turn it over, turn it over
I turn it back over to Zeus
Turn it over, turn it over
Turn it on over to Zeus

(all the women)
Turn it over, turn it over
Turn it on over to Zeus
(all the men)
Turn it over, turn it over
Turn it on over to Zeus
(everybody)
Turn it over, turn it over
Turn it on over to Zeus

Turn it over, turn it over
Turn it on over to Zeus
Turn it over, turn it over
Oom bop over to Zeus

Turn it over, turn it over
Turn it on over to Zeus

Holiday High


I'm gonna hunker down by a roaring fire with a piece of punkin pie
Bourbon in my coffee cup, no teardrops in my eye
My mother in law will soon arrive with a list of all my flaws
I'll just sit here in this easy chair like a drunken Santa Claus

You can't bring me down from my holiday high no matter how hard you try
These mashed potatoes won't eat themselves I'll protect myself with pie
I worked hard all year and now my dear I'll build a calorie coccoon
And I won't come back out again til New Years at Noon



FROSTY THE SNOWMAN

Mustache roasting by an open fire, [C Dm  C  Dm]
Jack in the Box nipping at your nose, [C  C7 F E7]
(pause) Tater tots with their eyes all aglow, [Am Fm6 C B7]
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.  [Em7 Dm7 G7 C]

Oh Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
with Cornbread Life and a button hose
And a keys made out of gold

Oh down through the village
With a flashlight in his hand
Driving here and there in a conversion van
Saying catch me if you can

Oh There must have been some magic 
in that rub-ber mask they found
Cause when he placed it on his head
a policeman punched him to the ground

And so I'm offering this simple phrase, [C Dm  C  Dm]
To kids from one to ninety-two, [C  C7 F E7]
Although its been said many times, many ways, [Am Fm6 C B7]
GARY Christmas to you [Em7 Am7 Dm7 G7, Cmaj7]

        E       A              E  
I was a ramblin man when I was young
          E       A                    E
I'll be a ramblin man till the days are done
          E                    A                 E 
I left my footprints along the road for y'all to see
                     E       B                E
I'm trying to find a ramblin man for to carry me

             A
I still got  lightning in my veins
              E
I still smell whiskey when it rains
          B
I'm still tempted by the night
              A                        E
I still don't sleep till I see the sun rise
        A                  E
I still fight for what I believe
                B                A
And I believe a woman is a mystery


Chorus

Now Austin is my home
And Houston's where I'm from
I got warrants up in Lubbock
And Acuna, you can just suck it
I still love the college towns
Love it when they say Drink One More Round

Chorus

Now, I still love old Willie's songs
I love the burnin in my lungs
I still love jumpin out of planes
I still go barefoot on the stage
I'm still a one woman man
I still get naked when I can

Chorus 

Trying to find that ramblin man from Galilee

You Can't Take It With You

 There ain't been no moon for the last 5 days
And there ain't been no rain so there won't be no hay
The cows can't eat 'cause the grass won't grow
So they stretch across the fence & eat the gravel off the road

Well I used to have a chicken but I hit hard times
And I just couldn't eat him so I, I had to hock him
And I took all the money that I got for that chicken
And I put it on red and I lost everything

You can't take it with you and you can't take your phone
It makes me cry that the money's all gone
And it makes me cry that we all got took
Humpty Dumpty didn't fall, he got pushed
You can't take it with you
You can't take it with you

So it's highly unlikely anything would change
And the way I see it, we got more than we need
And it don't seem likely that we won't want more
Cause were pissing all the money all over the floor

You can't take it with you, and you can't take your phone
And it makes me cry that the money's all gone
I know that it sounds like another excuse
Seems the more that I have, the more I loose
You can't take it with you
No you can't take it with you
Shifting Light of Day

In the morning I wake up
warm my hands on a coffee cup
and the eastern sky lights up
and i feel just fine
I head out to the road
each step a crunch of snow
in the white light I know
I'm gonna get mine


true to all the words I've spoken
no promises are broken
The sun in my eyes chases all my doubts away
In town on the boulevard some work will come my way
make a dollar in the shifting light of day


In the blue light of day
The shopkeepers say
we got no work or pay
No job to be found
As the sun drops to the West
like my last refused request
my feet could use some rest
and I'm feeling down

Of all the empty words I've spoken
My promises are broken
And it feels like all these doubts are here to stay
Down on the boulevard no work had come my way
Hopes are dim as the shifting light of day

This grey winter sky 
takes the best of me
And the cold wind blows 
through the rest of me

Folks back home can't see 
Just what's become of me
I don't expect they'd like it anyway
In town on the boulevard no work came my way
Hopes are dim as the shifting light of day

Here Tonight

The man on the radio 
said it's never been so cold
And it's coming tomorrow night
And it's gonna be a rainy day 
I wish that I could stay
Oh you know that's my favorite kind

Oh I don't your need your sympathy 
but I'd sure like your company today
So just sit here and talk to me
cause I believe I'll have to go away

Do you really think she looks like me
that's hard for me to see
but that's awfully nice of you
how'd she get to be so small 
that ain't like us at all
guess she got some of her daddy too

Oh I remember you that age, 
I have to say, I always liked you best 
smiling sweet without a care
but darling don't you dare tell the rest

I know- There's so much I'm gonna miss
So slow- Hard to see it going down like this
Did you hear at the end you see a light
Well my dear, I can see it here tonight

Well I can see it all so clear 
Has it been 50 years 
since the day Kennedy died
That boy sitting next to me 
Well, I would not have believed 
he'd be here still by my side

The years came down like falling leaves
New branches on the same old tree
I loved them and they loved me

	I know- There's so much I'm gonna miss
	So slow- Hard to see it going down like this
	Did you hear at the end you see a light
	Well my dear I can see it here tonight
Beautiful Accidents

He had the smell of tobacco smoke on his clothes
He didn't look a day over seventeen years old
She had the smell of magnolia on her hair
And a southern drawl that stretched from here to there
They didn't know what they were doing, but they knew it felt good
Turned out they didn't care about the why or should
He took her to the movie, she took his name
They moved to Texarkana when the baby came

Left turns and right turns get us here
All the beautiful accidents over the years
They look good on you
They look good on you
They look good on you
They look good on you

Right on the line, you grew up like a weed
Swimmin in the Red River all elbows and knees
A few years later and a few states away
My first job got me down the interstate
I stopped into a place, I didn't know what for
Hands in my pockets, both feet on the floor                                          
I was headin for the door, sick of standing around
Somehow I saw you so I cut through the crowd

Left turns and right turns get us here
All the beautiful accidents over the years
They look good on you
They look good on you
(solo last two good on yous, then solo)

When you said I do
I said I do too
Beautiful accidents
Beautiful accidents
Beautiful accidents

They look good on you
They look good on you
They look good on you
They look good on you

dont care for second best

Heart break pain joy John Wayne cowboy

Grand Illusion

That broken watch - don't throw it away
Cause it tells the right time - twice a day
Say the wrong thing - in just the right way
The way I see it - you got to grow or pay

Stand in line - pay to play

See the old friends - playing with their new phones
They got together- to spend time alone
They're all the same - skin and bones
The cars they drive, the loans they own

Now on sale- from General Confusion
Act now and buy- the Grand Illusion

Shiny toys - the new invention
Steals your time - demands attention
One more thing - I forgot to mention
The upgrade's- gonna cost your pension

Now on sale- from General Confusion

Left behind- from place to place

drop D

You eat too much candy 
you just might get sick 
I never had much cash in hand
I never learned that trick
Money doesn't talk boys
I tell you money screams
but i got more than enough- 
Cornbread and beans

My sisters got a Hooters job
Beer and chicken wings
My brother's got a four wheel drive
Bigfoot kind of thing  (That's a monster truck, y'all)
My uncles's got a mouth harp
and a Silvertone that rings
I've got a bent up deck of cards
Cornbread and beans

I never got to wreck a motel room,
Always had to sleep in my van
With the windows open
Can't afford to run the fan

Cocaine seemed like it might be fun
But it wasn't in my means
I got texaco coffee 
Cornbread and beans


You wont see my face
on a jumbo TV screen
I got a Waffle House cougar
and she likes the way I sing

You won't find us in
People Magazine
We'll down on Cheatham Street
Eatin cornbread and beans

There's a holes in the ozone
There's holes in my jeans
The whole world's gone to pot
I got cornbread and beans

capo 2 in C


St Johns Eve Gone to see Marie on Ponchartrain
12000 black and white standing in the rain
Gold stars on my forehead, Dont need no tarot deck
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck

Playing spoons on a box down on St Anns street
Hoodoo peppers freed a man charmed the judges seat
Silver dollar burned a hole, cashed my last paycheck
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck

Bonfire on midsummer's eve, ashes on my face
You might fall in love tonight or you might fall from grace
Creole on the bayou paying their respects
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck

Money on her resting place, Xs on the wall
Rainbow Snake has shed his skin, mark the sparrows fall
Free from all my burdens, paid up all my debts
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck

Leaning On Wine v2

My friend with the bottle is one I know well
The pleasures of drinking and raising all hell
Whiskey ran hot, it burned through our veins
Clouding my memory, drove me insane

Now I'm still drinking, but havin' calmer nights
Drinkin' more friendly 'stead of gettin' in fights
The pleasure I found is warm and it's fine
The pleasure I found is leaning on wine

Chorus
Leaning on wine, leaning on wine
It's getting so the clear moments are so hard to find-
'Cause these days I've been leaning on wine

I'm praying this season the weather is kind
Out in California to the grapes on the vine
If we get lucky, the sun's gonna shine
And we'll get together, leaning on wine

Chorus
Leaning on wine, leaning on wine
It's getting so the clear moments are so hard to find-
'Cause these days I've been leaning on wine

Leaning on wine, leaning on wine
It's getting so the clear moments are so hard to find-
'Cause these days I've been leaning on wine

Old Child Country Star

D

Down in Pacalios drinking Blue Ribbon Beer
Smoking on a Pall Mall, hauling in his gear
Setting up a tip jar, that's a hollow as a drum
Back in 52 he almost made number 1

He's an old child country star
He played the Grand Old Opry before he could drive a car
You may not believe it now hes 65
He's an old child country star
Got the twinkle in his eye

He was nine yrs old and the record man offered him that golden deal
Uncle Joe put his foot down said it was not ideal
They walked away from the table, did not sign that dotted line
Went back to third grade, thanks Joe, he did not hit big time

He's an old child country star
He's got a lifetime full of memories parked out in his yard
You may not believe it now hes 65
He's an old child country star
Got the winkle in his eye

Silver tones and steel guitars still ring in his ears
Black and white promo pictures fading through the years
That kid there in the photo, old timers deja vu/ He signed autographs for little girls for their mamas too
If you would like his autograph he's got one here just for you

He's an old child country star
He played the Grand Old Opry before he could drive a car
The lady with the fruit cake said that he'd go far
He's an old child
country star 

That winkle in his eye, he's got one just for you
He's an old child country star, old timers deja vu

That kid there in the photograph is the old man in the bar
He's an old child 
country star

Good Behavior

capo 2, play in C

He said you boys ain't the Opry, y'all ain't the Tennesee Three
It ain't no jailhouse rock, but it sounds all right to me
The warden said I feel like I've known you all my life
Would you be so kind as to sign this for my wife

They let him out on good behavior
Good behavior
They let him out on good behavior
Cause the show must go on

They let him out on work release and he played until the dawn
How could he play the squeezebox with the handcuffs on
He played Jolie Blon, he sang Take My Hand
I heard it sounded just as good as we practiced in the can

They let him out on good behavior
Good behavior
They let him out on good behavior
Cause the show must go on

He played the Lafayette State Fair, they heard him down at Beaumont Low
If he plays his cards right, no telling how far he'll go
You know his orange jumpsuit was provided by the state
The sheriff puts his lights on so he won't be late

They let him out on good behavior
Good behavior
They let him out on good behavior
Cause the show must go on

E                                                      F
He'll walk the straight and narrow, maybe it won't be long
C                                                   G
Maybe when he gets out of here, he'll write us a song
E                                                      F
And he'll sing it two states over, for suffering fools like me
C                                                       G
How three chords and the truth can set somebody free

They let him out on good behavior
Good behavior
They let him out on good behavior
Cause the show must go on

Just One More

3 chords, 6 strings and a hundred beers   /  100 beers
a lifetime of scars and bruises, laughter, joy and tears
who's round is it anyway, you may have heard this one before
a night of beer and stories, I think I'll have one more

Some things I love to remember, Some things I can't forget
My troubles must have learned to swim, and I can't drown them yet
Everything I tell you is the truth, half truths, and lies
that we all share together, raise your glass up high

Chorus

Man invented farming so he could make more beer
God made us thirsty, that's the reason why we're here
it's a universal language, an ancient recipe
songs go good with drinking so have one more with me

Chorus



Bought ourselves a broke down, torn up, beat up ghost of a home
The walls are coming down but the foundation's strong
Em                 C          
The first time that I saw it I went straight down to the bank
My friends all said I's crazy but I don't care what they think

There was something in the wind, like a whisper in my ear
Calling in a voice that only I could hear

(Saying)
Take me and break me down and--build me up like new
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess, I'm a worn out shell
But if you don't think my best days are through
Well, Then all I need is you

Sitting in the driveway of that home is a truck from my youth
She used to shine like a diamond but now she's black and blue
We used to fly out on that blacktop, man we'd let them horses run
Now it's like she's out to pasture, just cooking in the sun
 
(Still there's)
 something in the wind, like a whisper in my ear
Calling in a voice that only I could hear

(Saying)
Take me and break me down and--build me up like new
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess, I'm a worn out shell
But if you don't think my best days are through
Oh, then all I need is you

I've had blown out tires, been through fires, and I've seen a flood or two
I've fallen on my on my knees and begging please
Lord won't you pull me through
Won't you pull me through

Oh and
Take me and break me down and--build me up like new
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess, I'm a worn out shell
But if you don't think my best days are through
There's a whole lot of work to do
Then all I need is you
all I need is you





Winning Hand

I don't know know know- where we gonna go go go
but if you're down, let's go another round or two
Maybe baby, you can stay
Stick around and we can see this whole thing through

           So let's go, let the dice roll
           Bet it all, I got a winning hand with you

     Take a million chances, dance a million dances

     Don't worry bout tomorrow, there's gonna be some sorrow
     But if I don't fall, I can't get back up with you

But I got faith in you and you got hope in me
If it gets cold, you got a hand to hold
So don't let go, you got to put your trust in me

     We're gonna take a million chances, dance a million dances
     Do it all our whole life through
     Don't worry bout tomorrow, there's gonna be some sorrow
     But if I don't fall, I can't get back up with you

           So let's go, let the dice roll
           Bet it all, I got a winning hand with you
           Let's go, let the dice roll
           Bet it all, I got a winning hand with you
